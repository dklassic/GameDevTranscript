1
00:00:09,704 --> 00:00:12,408
那等一下的演講因為全部都是用英文進行

2
00:00:12,408 --> 00:00:18,496
所以如果有特定需求的時候我會就是看狀況會做一點翻譯這樣

3
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:21,680
然後或者是說等一下大家有什麼問題想要提問的話呢

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,361
就是可以直接

5
00:00:35,497 --> 00:00:45,291
I just want to apologize because I'm very very very tired. We just launched a game this week

6
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,456
So yes, if I seem a little bit dead, it's because I am

7
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:48,756
But

8
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,440
Let's commence.

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,261
So, who am I?

10
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,482
I'm Ian.

11
00:00:54,482 --> 00:00:56,183
Many of you look familiar.

12
00:00:56,183 --> 00:00:58,544
I think I saw you last time.

13
00:00:58,544 --> 00:00:59,425
So you may know me.

14
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:01,766
I'm the co-founder of Another Indie,

15
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:07,290
and I'm the person who does all the project management of our titles.

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:07,910
I'm okay at it.

17
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,031
I'm okay at it.

18
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:13,233
I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm good at it.

19
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:17,536
And what I want to talk about today is time management.

20
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:17,596
Woo!

21
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:25,243
Super exciting stuff.

22
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:28,429
And why do I want to talk about time management?

23
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:33,037
Well, the reason why I want to talk about time management is very, very simple.

24
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:36,562
because people keep fucking it up.

25
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:44,725
It's becoming very, very obvious to me that a lot of indie developers,

26
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:50,246
smaller, first-time developers, are struggling to understand

27
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:55,728
the needs and necessities that come about not just making a game,

28
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:57,869
but making a successful game.

29
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:01,154
And those are two very, very, very different things.

30
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:06,817
You can make a very, very good game and still fail.

31
00:02:06,817 --> 00:02:11,159
In fact, you probably will make a very good game

32
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,120
and still fail.

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,701
That's the situation in 2018.

34
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,603
So what you need to be doing is figuring out

35
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:21,745
how you can maximise your chances of success.

36
00:02:21,745 --> 00:02:24,687
And time management is incredibly important

37
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:27,368
because every week wasted.

38
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:35,961
is money that you are spending. It's time that you cannot get back. So that is what

39
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:40,585
I want to do. I want to talk to you about that today and tell you a little bit about

40
00:02:40,585 --> 00:02:46,509
how we do it and point out some of the things that I see developers doing that they should

41
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:54,336
not be doing. And just for a clarification, nobody knows what they're doing.

42
00:02:55,289 --> 00:03:00,031
I don't really know what I'm doing, I'm just doing my best, but I've been doing it for

43
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:06,132
a long time now, so I have some understanding of it that might be different from yours.

44
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:11,814
So if what I say does not apply to you, that's fine.

45
00:03:11,814 --> 00:03:18,256
And if you have any questions or any disagreements with me, please let me know, because I want

46
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:22,377
to hear from people who tell me I'm a lying bullshitter.

47
00:03:22,377 --> 00:03:23,898
That's totally fine.

48
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:33,753
So, I've broken it down into three categories. Three things that I think that you guys need

49
00:03:33,753 --> 00:03:40,937
to be focusing on. Do any of you have any idea what my three categories are? Come on,

50
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:46,161
it's a test. If you fail, terrible. Come on, give me a category.

51
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:49,363
Launching time.

52
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:55,007
Launching time. Partially. So, three categories. The first one is...

53
00:03:55,306 --> 00:04:02,088
kind of like what you were saying, developing your game, right?

54
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:03,429
So the first thing that you're actually...

55
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:04,749
Most of you are developers, right?

56
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:05,550
Yes? No?

57
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,691
I mean, if you're not, you're in the wrong room.

58
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:11,052
Somebody say, I'm here for Pokémon Go!

59
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:15,273
But yeah, the first thing that you guys are probably focusing on

60
00:04:15,273 --> 00:04:17,514
is developing your game,

61
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:19,995
which is very understandable.

62
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:23,817
It's a very, very, very important part of the process.

63
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:31,567
But, there are two other things that I think are equally important, and I want to emphasize

64
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:41,118
this, equally important as to actually developing the game in terms of making a successful game.

65
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:44,622
First one is building your community.

66
00:04:45,793 --> 00:04:47,893
This is really, really hard.

67
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:51,795
And we'll talk about how to do this later on,

68
00:04:51,795 --> 00:04:55,756
but a lot of developers are not doing this.

69
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:59,177
And by building your community, I do not mean

70
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:02,377
having a Facebook account and uploading a picture

71
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:03,878
once a week.

72
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:05,658
That is not building a community,

73
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:07,959
that is having a Facebook account.

74
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,300
And I don't know how many of you check your Facebooks.

75
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:15,189
I guess it's not many because Facebook does not seem to be doing a good job in terms of

76
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,973
retention and in terms of engagement and things like that.

77
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:23,817
So if your community is based around exclusively something like Facebook, you're probably going

78
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:25,659
to run into problems.

79
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,080
We use Discord.

80
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,221
Do any of you use Discord?

81
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:31,072
It's fucking amazing, right?

82
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:34,153
Like, with Discord, you can do pretty much anything

83
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:35,414
that you can imagine doing.

84
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:39,875
You can set up bots to do all sorts of the work for you,

85
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:43,156
and you can have a really, really, really solid community

86
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:45,217
right from the word go.

87
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:48,038
You can customize it to do what you want.

88
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:51,199
We started our Discord about a year and a half ago.

89
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,120
We now have 3,000 people in our Discord,

90
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,280
and that's 3,000 active members

91
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,421
because we prune inactive members.

92
00:05:58,997 --> 00:06:07,122
So even for a really small, tiny publisher like us, to have 3,000 people signal boosting

93
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:10,604
your projects, it's absolutely incredible.

94
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:17,148
We get more out of our Discord than we do out of anything else we do.

95
00:06:17,148 --> 00:06:18,829
So really look into that.

96
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,930
And the other one is, of course, marketing.

97
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,053
Both traditional marketing and modern marketing.

98
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:25,933
Getting in touch with press.

99
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:33,413
out there, getting eyeballs on your game, and also getting influencers, you know, the

100
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:42,298
streamers, the Twitter people, the Billy Billy, PandaTV, WaveWall, all of these lovely, lovely

101
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:47,301
people that we have to work with these days, and getting them interested and getting them

102
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:50,302
kind of connected to your game and your project.

103
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:54,405
So those are the three things that I think you guys all need to be

104
00:06:54,775 --> 00:07:00,440
focusing on and that you all need to have a plan for, you all need to be scheduling

105
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:00,620
for.

106
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,305
You can't have it that, oh, I will finish my game and then I will start this.

107
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:12,990
It's almost impossible unless you want to spend one year sitting on top of a game, okay?

108
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,194
So you need to be linking all of these things up together.

109
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:20,557
Which means this all needs to be happening simultaneously.

110
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:29,841
So while you are developing your game, you need to be managing all of these different things.

111
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:31,884
Howarma?

112
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,366
So easy. So easy.

113
00:07:34,823 --> 00:07:39,148
Here's a little bit of what I think you need to have on your launch.

114
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:43,832
And bear in mind, all of the advice I'm giving you right now is very, very, very generic.

115
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:46,875
Every game is completely different and will have different ideas.

116
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,758
But this is kind of a rough guide of what you need to have.

117
00:07:49,758 --> 00:07:51,980
So you need a strong community.

118
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:55,480
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Discord, all helpful.

119
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,343
A press kit sent out in advance, in advance.

120
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:04,747
You cannot send your game to media and give them one week to play your game and expect

121
00:08:04,747 --> 00:08:07,109
them to write about your game.

122
00:08:07,109 --> 00:08:07,889
It's not enough time.

123
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:10,751
And I see this all the time.

124
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,373
People saying, oh I'm launching my game next week.

125
00:08:19,964 --> 00:08:22,426
Because in 2018, everybody's inbox is full.

126
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:26,389
So you need to give them as much time as possible.

127
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:29,731
I try to give a minimum of six weeks,

128
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:34,334
which means that the game has to be finished,

129
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:38,037
the game has to be uploaded, the game has to be playable,

130
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:41,240
and it needs to be distributable six weeks

131
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,161
before I actually launch it.

132
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:47,688
which is a month and a half early.

133
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:51,052
So when you put that in the grand scheme of things,

134
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:52,914
it becomes a big difference, a big change.

135
00:08:52,914 --> 00:08:56,458
And as well as just the game in your press kit,

136
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:00,222
you're gonna wanna have a trailer, and those are fun.

137
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:03,165
Have you guys made trailers yet?

138
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:03,946
Yeah, that's gonna be fun.

139
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:04,747
Trailers are great.

140
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,692
uh... screenshots gifts and of course you don't want to have an actual press

141
00:09:09,692 --> 00:09:10,373
release

142
00:09:10,373 --> 00:09:15,435
which needs to be in very good english or very good chinese or japanese or

143
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:18,977
russian or whichever language you're pitching it in

144
00:09:18,977 --> 00:09:20,538
it's a lot of work

145
00:09:20,538 --> 00:09:23,839
it's not just a case of finishing the game and then shipping it anymore

146
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,421
once upon a time you could put your game on steam and it would sell

147
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:31,963
we don't live in that world anymore and if you're a mobile developer as i think

148
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:34,685
most of you are

149
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:40,280
You know, I come from a PC and console space, which is difficult.

150
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,703
For those of you who are working in mobile, God bless you.

151
00:09:45,703 --> 00:09:47,564
God bless you.

152
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:53,906
You also need to have a media presence before you launch your game.

153
00:09:53,906 --> 00:10:01,970
Launching your game without any kind of previews or any kind of news is really, really dangerous.

154
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,570
People aren't aware of your brand.

155
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:09,041
So before you launch your game, figure out, like, okay, when can I give people a demo?

156
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,602
When can I give people a preview?

157
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:12,644
When do I want to schedule this in?

158
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:14,546
Is it even possible?

159
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:21,012
And you want to make sure that you are doing a good job on influencer outreach and connections.

160
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:24,195
Influencers are so, so, so important these days.

161
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:36,091
You want to make sure that the Twitch people, the YouTube people, the Bilibili people, PandaTV people, all of these people from all over the world have access to your game.

162
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:41,352
If they don't, they aren't going to come knocking on your door.

163
00:10:41,352 --> 00:10:45,233
Unless you've done an amazing job showcasing and things like that.

164
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:54,135
But showcasing is hard because we live in Taiwan and in order to showcase effectively you need to go to America.

165
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,052
So, it's tough. It's tough.

166
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:04,213
So how do I do this?

167
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:07,414
So when I get a game, the first thing that I do

168
00:11:07,414 --> 00:11:09,414
is I break it down into milestones.

169
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:10,955
Do you know what a milestone is?

170
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:11,915
Is that a common term?

171
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:12,915
Cool.

172
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:15,716
So I break it down into milestones.

173
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,257
So I sit down with the three pillars

174
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:21,078
and I figure out the milestones for each game.

175
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:23,839
What do I need to do and when do I need to do it?

176
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:24,239
Okay?

177
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:27,760
And then once I have all the milestones,

178
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,580
I put them together, okay?

179
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:33,491
So let's have a look at some of these milestones.

180
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:37,435
I am not a developer, so my development milestones

181
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:39,477
are purely from the outside.

182
00:11:39,477 --> 00:11:41,739
So developers among you are probably looking

183
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:44,141
at my milestones going, ah!

184
00:11:44,141 --> 00:11:48,404
But from the outside, these are the ones that matter to me

185
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:50,106
when it comes to selling your game, okay?

186
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:52,448
So the first thing you're gonna wanna get

187
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:54,350
is the cross-slice, you know what a cross-slice is?

188
00:11:55,153 --> 00:12:01,997
It's a version of your game that allows people to understand what your game is.

189
00:12:01,997 --> 00:12:07,881
It does not necessarily need to be a full demo. It can be five minutes long.

190
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:16,187
It's designed to give people like me and other industry people a good idea of what your game is.

191
00:12:16,187 --> 00:12:16,627
Okay?

192
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:21,991
Do you remember PT?

193
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:22,731
Silent Hill PT?

194
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:30,575
Excellent example of a cross slide. You know the game was not going to be like that, but

195
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:33,336
you play that and you know exactly what they are aiming for.

196
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:39,859
A playable demo. This is usually number two. And this can be useful for a number of things.

197
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:45,502
It can be useful for building a community, it can be useful for getting press involved,

198
00:12:45,502 --> 00:12:50,944
anything. Number three, your first pass. You have a finished version of the game, it's

199
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:51,345
probably

200
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,224
It's probably got missing pieces, but I can play it beginning to end.

201
00:13:00,224 --> 00:13:04,428
Polished version for testing, this is my favourite one because it means we're nearly there.

202
00:13:04,428 --> 00:13:08,232
And then the final version, the one that we launch.

203
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:17,481
But of course in development these days there's also 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 with patches and updates and content and DLC and all this other stuff.

204
00:13:18,037 --> 00:13:22,719
But these are the ones that you kind of need to be scheduling for right now.

205
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:30,344
So if you have a game under development and you have no idea when these things are coming,

206
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,925
you need to sit down, look at your process and figure it out.

207
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:39,569
Because without these dates, it's impossible to do anything else.

208
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,270
Until you have a rough idea of when this will happen.

209
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:49,183
nothing else will work because the development thing is the thing in the middle.

210
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:54,565
Everything else is connected to it. So if this thing is...

211
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:57,606
it's a big problem. So,

212
00:13:57,606 --> 00:14:01,268
marketing milestones. Now this is where I know what I'm talking about.

213
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:05,249
Okay, so this is how we break it down

214
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:09,410
basically. We do a launch announcement which is basically saying

215
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,612
Hey! Look! This game exists! Woo!

216
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:18,224
It has a trailer, a press release, and sometimes, but not always, a demo.

217
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,026
Sometimes it just has the trailer and the press release.

218
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:27,551
So for Cine, when we first announced Cine, we did not release a demo at that time.

219
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:32,114
So number two you can skip if you don't have a demo at this time.

220
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:38,459
So you release this to press and you hope, you hope, that you get some interest.

221
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,741
If you do not get interest, you need to kind of...

222
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:47,139
Look at why. Is your game too similar to things on the market?

223
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:51,120
Is your pitching not correct? How can you make it more interesting?

224
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,561
This is actually a great time to

225
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:58,403
really re-evaluate if you have done something wrong.

226
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:03,004
So for example with Cynna, did any of you guys see Cynna?

227
00:15:03,004 --> 00:15:04,585
We launched it this week, so just say yes.

228
00:15:04,795 --> 00:15:11,320
So, we launched Cinna this week and our launch announcement was really, really successful

229
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,904
because loads of people wrote about it and loads of people saw it.

230
00:15:15,904 --> 00:15:20,027
But it was really unsuccessful for a different reason.

231
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:22,249
We did not do our messaging well enough.

232
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:30,155
So people saw the game, they said, that looks fucking cool, but they did not realise what

233
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:31,837
the game was.

234
00:15:31,837 --> 00:15:33,918
They got their own idea.

235
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:41,486
Action RPG, and it wasn't. It was a small boss battler.

236
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:50,416
So suddenly, we were in a situation where we had to fight against the expectations of the people who had seen the trailer.

237
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,439
And that's a dangerous position to put yourself in.

238
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:56,222
So make sure that you get your messaging on point as well.

239
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,884
So we're all learning.

240
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:05,704
Follow up, if you send out a press release and people don't cover your game, give it

241
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:11,648
a couple of weeks and then ask, hey I sent you a press release, I know you didn't cover

242
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:13,789
it, can you tell me why?

243
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:18,832
You will probably only get one, two, three responses, but you will get some, and those

244
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:22,495
responses will be incredibly useful.

245
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:28,799
If they did cover your game, you want to message them and say...

246
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:34,753
Hey, thanks for covering my game and give them more meat.

247
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:42,759
So for example, what we did when Cine got picked up by a lot of press is we then started pitching to them with other ideas.

248
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:53,026
Hey, by the way, did you know that Cine was developed in China by AAA indie devs who have decided, AAA developers who've gone indie? How cool is that?

249
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:54,847
They're like, yeah, that is cool.

250
00:16:55,451 --> 00:17:01,537
And suddenly, we had a few articles being written about this kind of story of these

251
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:07,662
developers from Shanghai got together and, you know, a real kind of Robin Hood story.

252
00:17:07,662 --> 00:17:08,243
Great.

253
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:09,364
Excellent branding.

254
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:16,450
So what is interesting or exciting, not just about your game, but about you?

255
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:20,275
What story are you trying to tell for your companies?

256
00:17:20,275 --> 00:17:22,096
Because remember, if you're making a game,

257
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:23,477
it's not just about that game,

258
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:24,817
it's also about your next game,

259
00:17:24,817 --> 00:17:26,858
and the game after that, and the game after that.

260
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:28,859
So you wanna be building up this narrative

261
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:30,019
about who you are.

262
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:32,720
If you want the perfect example of this,

263
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,001
look at Devolver Digital.

264
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:38,082
They did an amazing job of creating a brand for themselves

265
00:17:38,082 --> 00:17:44,264
as these cheeky, rude, naughty games publishers.

266
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,465
And they've maintained that brand for,

267
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:51,136
nearly ten years now, and it's done very well for them.

268
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,517
So think about that.

269
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:57,580
How are you positioning yourself and how are you making yourself stand out, not just your

270
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:57,840
game?

271
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,463
And the next step is the launch date announcement.

272
00:18:03,463 --> 00:18:08,586
So the first thing you want to do is say, hey, we have a game.

273
00:18:08,586 --> 00:18:14,509
Don't give a launch date unless you are certain you know that launch date, okay?

274
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:16,070
This is another mistake I have made.

275
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:21,595
we announced the launch date and then we decided to postpone.

276
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:26,018
Very dangerous people do not like this.

277
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:31,260
We actually made the right decision because we announced the launch date before the Nintendo

278
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,442
Switch came out, and then the Nintendo Switch came out and we went,

279
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:37,424
yeah, we want some of that Nintendo love.

280
00:18:37,424 --> 00:18:39,445
And it worked out very well for us.

281
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:39,925
But...

282
00:18:40,812 --> 00:18:43,573
Be very careful with that because this can backfire a lot.

283
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:45,634
So do not announce a launch date until you know

284
00:18:45,634 --> 00:18:47,794
that you've got that launch date.

285
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,075
You need another trailer, you need another press release.

286
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:53,556
So your press release needs to give obviously

287
00:18:53,556 --> 00:18:58,657
the date, the time, but also needs to give more details.

288
00:18:58,657 --> 00:18:59,778
So remember this, don't give away everything

289
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:00,718
in the first point.

290
00:19:00,718 --> 00:19:03,799
Don't lay out your life story in the first press release.

291
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,960
You have to keep information back.

292
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,220
You have to hold back and you have to give it out

293
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:08,700
at certain times.

294
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:12,185
At this point, you need to start doing your influencer outreach as well.

295
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:18,009
If you haven't already started it, at this point, you need to be doing influencer outreach.

296
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:24,034
Six weeks before launch, you need to launch the press release, Embargoed, and then on

297
00:19:24,034 --> 00:19:29,999
the actual launch day, you need to have, again, another trailer and more information.

298
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:30,459
Okay?

299
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:33,101
Can you explain a bit more about Embargoed?

300
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:34,482
Because this is a term that we...

301
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:43,998
Okay, so embargo is basically you send an email to a press organization saying,

302
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:49,983
here is a copy of my game for review, do not release the review until X date.

303
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:59,190
Because you don't want, if you launch your game, so if you give press your game six weeks in advance,

304
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,452
you don't want review.

305
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:06,535
three days, review, two days, review, three days, review, four days, review, because it

306
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:11,559
just spreads it out too much. Because what you need is one big punch. So you want to

307
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:17,984
make sure that all of those reviews are coming out at the same time. So that's what embargoes

308
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:24,068
allow you to do. And by and large, press quite like embargoes that I've given ahead, because

309
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:28,892
it gives them time. Because right now, that's the big problem for games journalists, is

310
00:20:28,892 --> 00:20:29,653
just that...

311
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:31,254
There are so many games.

312
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:35,154
So the more time you give them, the more likely you are

313
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:36,935
to actually get coverage.

314
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:43,356
One note, influencers are really bad with embargoes.

315
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:45,036
Really bad with embargoes.

316
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,057
So it's a good idea to maybe do the press

317
00:20:48,057 --> 00:20:51,597
and then two weeks before launch, release to influencers.

318
00:20:51,597 --> 00:20:56,078
Because influencers get far too excited.

319
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:57,498
And usually don't have the same kind of

320
00:20:57,498 --> 00:20:58,878
professional training.

321
00:20:59,255 --> 00:21:00,836
that a games journalist will have.

322
00:21:00,836 --> 00:21:07,121
Okay, what about community? Before you do anything you need to get your community

323
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:08,201
stuff prepared. Like,

324
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:11,804
I have genuinely seen on multiple occasions

325
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:16,668
people doing all of this

326
00:21:16,668 --> 00:21:19,750
all of their marketing stuff and then

327
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,993
launching Facebook, Twitter, and things two weeks before their games come out.

328
00:21:23,993 --> 00:21:28,676
This is craziness. Do you guys know what a market funnel is?

329
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:34,882
So a funnel is, I don't have anywhere to draw, do I?

330
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:38,963
So imagine that you are trying to get water

331
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:41,023
from a big thing into a little thing,

332
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:43,644
and you are pouring it, okay?

333
00:21:43,644 --> 00:21:44,644
So you use a funnel, right?

334
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:47,885
So what you want to do is you want to structure

335
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:51,826
your marketing and community plan like a funnel.

336
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:57,307
Every time you do an announcement or do a release,

337
00:21:57,307 --> 00:22:00,928
you need to pick one place.

338
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:07,355
where you want all of those interested people to end up.

339
00:22:07,355 --> 00:22:12,757
So for example, it used to be Facebook, like I said, that used to be when I first got into

340
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:15,238
the business, that's where everybody wanted everyone to be.

341
00:22:15,238 --> 00:22:20,980
You put them to Facebook, but then Facebook changed its monetisation structure and even

342
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,662
if people like your page, there's no guarantee they will see your post.

343
00:22:25,662 --> 00:22:28,683
So suddenly Facebook became not very useful.

344
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:35,010
So what we have now is we have Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, all of these things, but all of

345
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:40,373
those things are designed to push people towards the Discord.

346
00:22:40,373 --> 00:22:46,857
So when we pour out the news, people get caught in our social media.

347
00:22:46,857 --> 00:22:51,159
So we get X number of people, X number of people, X number of people in our social media.

348
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:55,602
And then the really committed people, the ones who really like the game...

349
00:22:56,224 --> 00:23:02,766
go into our Discord, because that's how we've got it set up. We have links to the Discord and all those things, okay?

350
00:23:02,766 --> 00:23:10,910
And then you end up with, for every announcement, a few hundred people who really fucking like your game.

351
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:18,393
Who have gone through a couple of stages to get there, they're excited to talk to the developers, they're committed to the idea,

352
00:23:18,393 --> 00:23:20,374
and those people are so important.

353
00:23:21,807 --> 00:23:26,870
So yeah, like I said, you need to have your social media prepared before you do any announcements,

354
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,811
before you release a screenshot, before you send a message to anyone.

355
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:33,233
You need to have social media, community stuff set up.

356
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:36,535
Pick a home for your community, okay?

357
00:23:36,535 --> 00:23:41,477
If you're not going to use Discord, find something else but commit to it, okay?

358
00:23:41,477 --> 00:23:48,181
Some people still use forums, you know, it's not a bad idea, it's just a pain in the ass.

359
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:55,214
and get some moderators and do not forget about time zones.

360
00:23:55,214 --> 00:24:01,816
I remember when me and Vlad, we first opened our Discord and we were like,

361
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:08,099
oh this is great, this is great. Me and Vlad, we'll monitor it all day, it's gonna be perfect.

362
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:08,479
We live in Asia.

363
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:14,421
So when all the Americans wake up and you get some horrible, horrible American boy

364
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:17,482
who wants to post Nazi memes and pornography,

365
00:24:20,222 --> 00:24:27,565
So make sure that you're thinking like, okay, have somebody in that community promoted.

366
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:35,108
If you manage to get 100 people in your Discord, you have 3 or 4 people who are desperate to be moderators.

367
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:36,809
Who are desperate to get involved.

368
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:42,311
Say, I will give you free copies of all of our games for as long as you are a moderator.

369
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:45,453
Happy. Happy. Happy, happy people.

370
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:50,174
Make sure you include your community in all press releases.

371
00:24:50,174 --> 00:24:53,876
Most press will not say, go to the Discord,

372
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:55,757
or go to this, or go to that.

373
00:24:55,757 --> 00:24:57,237
But some will.

374
00:24:57,237 --> 00:24:59,298
And it has a massive impact.

375
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:02,740
I think we had a Rock Paper Shotgun article once

376
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,622
that included a link to our Discord,

377
00:25:05,622 --> 00:25:09,183
and suddenly our Discord grew by like 400 people.

378
00:25:09,183 --> 00:25:09,484
Just boom.

379
00:25:09,484 --> 00:25:12,805
Exciting.

380
00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:14,586
Run competitions.

381
00:25:15,632 --> 00:25:17,974
do things to interact with your community.

382
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:22,257
So in the Another Indie server right now, we do

383
00:25:22,257 --> 00:25:25,259
Netflix Movie Night, where we just say

384
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:29,522
at this time we will be watching this movie. Join us.

385
00:25:29,522 --> 00:25:33,105
And so people who are bored, because they must be very bored,

386
00:25:33,105 --> 00:25:35,907
will say cool. And so last weekend

387
00:25:35,907 --> 00:25:39,650
me, Vlad, and about 30 people from our Discord

388
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,931
we watched Hellraiser.

389
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:45,304
and just chatted like, oh, he's gonna kill her,

390
00:25:45,304 --> 00:25:45,964
oh, she's dead.

391
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:48,765
And people love it, you know?

392
00:25:48,765 --> 00:25:51,507
Everyone's sharing Hellraiser memes,

393
00:25:51,507 --> 00:25:54,549
everybody's chatting, and it just gives that community

394
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:57,370
that little bit more of, we're not just here

395
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:57,970
to sell you shit.

396
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,612
Obviously, in the end, you want your community

397
00:26:01,612 --> 00:26:04,774
to be a part of your sales strategy,

398
00:26:04,774 --> 00:26:07,836
but you also want it to be an actual community.

399
00:26:07,836 --> 00:26:10,457
Otherwise, people get bored very, very quickly.

400
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:14,684
So yeah, we do that, and we also do competitions.

401
00:26:14,684 --> 00:26:16,345
We do loads of competitions.

402
00:26:16,345 --> 00:26:19,007
You know the Humble subscription?

403
00:26:19,007 --> 00:26:21,709
You pay like, what is it, $15 a month,

404
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:25,672
and you get access to games every month, like Steam Keys?

405
00:26:25,672 --> 00:26:29,796
Humble's monthly fee is the payment method.

406
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,636
Yeah, well, he said.

407
00:26:30,636 --> 00:26:34,479
We do that, and we have one just for our Discord.

408
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:37,442
So what we do is we get all of those keys every month,

409
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:38,843
and we run competitions for them.

410
00:26:38,843 --> 00:26:40,344
It's super cheap.

411
00:26:41,294 --> 00:26:47,717
But you then have two or three competitions a week, no problem, less than $20 a month.

412
00:26:47,717 --> 00:26:49,378
Bargain.

413
00:26:49,378 --> 00:26:54,600
And it's a good way to just get people interacting, and you do it so.

414
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,662
So the way that we do it is, we have a level up system in our Discord.

415
00:26:59,662 --> 00:27:06,405
So the more that you chat, the more that you post, the more that you interact, the higher your level goes.

416
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:10,587
And the higher your level is, the more likely you are to win prizes.

417
00:27:11,317 --> 00:27:14,697
So people talk and interact because there's extra motivation.

418
00:27:14,697 --> 00:27:17,218
So do things like that.

419
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:26,720
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to kind of give you an overview of a game launch.

420
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,481
Which is a little bit boring. I apologize in advance.

421
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:39,422
So let's say the launch date for Ian's Ultimate Indie is on July 1st.

422
00:27:40,444 --> 00:27:42,165
Oh no, we cut off a little bit.

423
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:42,585
Oh, it's OK.

424
00:27:42,585 --> 00:27:43,586
I can read it to you.

425
00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:44,066
You'll be fine.

426
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:48,108
This is like a breakdown of what you

427
00:27:48,108 --> 00:27:53,951
need to do in those months before you launch your game.

428
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:56,593
So this is six months, OK?

429
00:27:56,593 --> 00:28:00,835
And six months sounds like a long time, right?

430
00:28:00,835 --> 00:28:06,718
When you think like, oh, six months is nothing in game dev.

431
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,200
Six months is absolutely nothing.

432
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,500
It's OK.

433
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:19,447
If you're thinking like, oh I'm going to launch my game in quarter three in 2019.

434
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,769
May-wenty.

435
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:29,176
You've got three months to get all of this prepared.

436
00:28:29,176 --> 00:28:31,478
And that's quite scary.

437
00:28:32,642 --> 00:28:38,526
In January, you're launching in July, in January you need to have prepared community and social

438
00:28:38,526 --> 00:28:43,649
media, minimal posting, prepare the assets you will need for the launch announcement,

439
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:45,190
prepare the store page assets.

440
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,573
If you're launching on Steam, you want to make sure that your store page is ready the

441
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:53,476
minute that you do your launch announcement because you want to get those wish lists because

442
00:28:53,476 --> 00:28:55,297
that's how you get the algorithm to love you.

443
00:28:55,297 --> 00:29:01,041
And you need assets and announcement trailer, okay?

444
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:02,081
That's month one.

445
00:29:03,135 --> 00:29:08,220
Month two, you need to announce the game, kick off social media, begin funneling people

446
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:13,025
towards your hood, have the store page go live for wishlisting, release the demo for

447
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:14,746
press and influencers.

448
00:29:14,746 --> 00:29:21,213
Third month, follow up with those press and influencers, continue developing your community,

449
00:29:21,213 --> 00:29:25,377
pitch new stories, explain why your game is special to people who are interested.

450
00:29:26,122 --> 00:29:31,646
Do a giveaway, give restricted access of the game to your community to get that feedback.

451
00:29:31,646 --> 00:29:34,648
Use your community as beta testers.

452
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:37,891
Prepare press releases and launch day's announcement.

453
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:38,931
May.

454
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:43,035
In May, your game needs to be finished.

455
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:50,240
So if you are launching in July, your game needs to be finished by the second week of

456
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,463
May in order to give press that six weeks.

457
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:56,187
of a glorious, glorious...

458
00:29:56,187 --> 00:30:02,350
So you see how quickly that time disappears, right?

459
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,391
Yeah.

460
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:08,393
So, in May, the first two weeks, you're focusing on finalising the game,

461
00:30:08,393 --> 00:30:11,695
whilst also maintaining community and building up all of that stuff.

462
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:15,497
Also, and then on the July 1st, sorry, not July 1st,

463
00:30:15,497 --> 00:30:19,879
mid-May, you want to announce the launch date.

464
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:20,620
So you say...

465
00:30:20,915 --> 00:30:27,079
Woo! The game will be coming out July 1st. Send that press release to the press.

466
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:31,202
At the same time, send your embargoed press release.

467
00:30:31,202 --> 00:30:34,124
So you basically send two press kits at one time.

468
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:38,487
One with the saying, saying, hey the game's coming out on July 1st.

469
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:49,075
Another one with a key to the game, with all the information about the launch, and with the embargo information as well.

470
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:49,235
In June...

471
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:56,284
you're still preparing all of your social media, you're preparing the launch date stuff,

472
00:30:56,284 --> 00:31:02,985
and you're updating all of the bugs that you will still be finding, because you will still

473
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:07,687
be finding bugs at this point. And you pray. You pray that everything will go well, and

474
00:31:07,687 --> 00:31:14,788
then in July, boom, your game's out. So that's what six months looks like. It goes very,

475
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:18,429
very, very, very, very, very quickly.

476
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,242
trying to put something into this.

477
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:23,704
Go for it.

478
00:31:23,704 --> 00:31:30,491
So in this six-month schedule, I didn't see anything

479
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:31,813
about play testing.

480
00:31:31,813 --> 00:31:35,256
Yeah, how do you combine those?

481
00:31:35,256 --> 00:31:39,040
So what we do is we do QA in-house,

482
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,282
but we now use our community.

483
00:31:41,282 --> 00:31:42,203
So we have.

484
00:31:47,103 --> 00:31:52,464
3,000 people we have 100 elite members you know they are called the a we are

485
00:31:52,464 --> 00:31:59,046
another in the so we call it the AI Alliance and those members of the AI

486
00:31:59,046 --> 00:32:06,047
Alliance they are the people that we bring in to test our games and to give

487
00:32:06,047 --> 00:32:10,468
us feedback so we have 100 people just players

488
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:16,722
We do QA with external groups as well, to make sure that we do that.

489
00:32:16,722 --> 00:32:25,869
But yeah, playtesting is hugely important. I just left it off this one because you all know about QA.

490
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:28,611
Did you have any other questions?

491
00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:30,552
Yeah, just that one.

492
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:37,637
Just that one. Cool, cool, cool. So yeah, do test your game. Don't forget that.

493
00:32:37,637 --> 00:32:39,358
And bearing in mind that...

494
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:40,831
No, the chair.

495
00:32:40,831 --> 00:32:42,232
Oh, it's just a chair.

496
00:32:42,232 --> 00:32:46,076
I was like, who brought a fucking cat?

497
00:32:46,076 --> 00:32:53,242
And, and bearing in mind that all of this information that I've just given you here

498
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:57,846
is for launching on PC only.

499
00:32:57,846 --> 00:33:00,708
If you want to launch on console,

500
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:01,949
Ha ha ha ha!

501
00:33:01,949 --> 00:33:07,114
Everything needs to be done. The game needs to be done.

502
00:33:07,896 --> 00:33:13,539
two or three months earlier than this, because you have to get through lockcheck and things

503
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:14,539
like that.

504
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:20,142
So you need to be factoring all of this in and putting this all together.

505
00:33:20,142 --> 00:33:25,265
So if you want to make it even more complicated, add a console.

506
00:33:25,265 --> 00:33:27,926
That's what we did with Synapse.

507
00:33:27,926 --> 00:33:31,788
We were like, ah, we'll do Xbox and Switch and PlayStation, it'll be easy!

508
00:33:31,788 --> 00:33:33,669
And then, poor Frank nearly died.

509
00:33:36,487 --> 00:33:38,747
I look tired, look at Frank.

510
00:33:38,747 --> 00:33:42,189
So, hot tips.

511
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:42,789
Hot tips.

512
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:47,310
Be quiet about your game

513
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:51,372
until you are ready to go.

514
00:33:51,372 --> 00:33:53,773
Not go as in sell your game,

515
00:33:53,773 --> 00:33:55,573
but be quiet until you are,

516
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:58,715
you know, you have this six month cycle, okay?

517
00:33:58,715 --> 00:34:02,016
If you are talking about your game

518
00:34:02,016 --> 00:34:04,197
years before your game will come out,

519
00:34:11,787 --> 00:34:18,469
many good games. So if you're talking about your game years before it comes out, this

520
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:23,451
is probably going to bite you in the ass, because people will lose their excitement.

521
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:32,215
You need to keep that excitement going. In my experience, the thing that always goes

522
00:34:32,215 --> 00:34:39,898
wrong is the development stuff. Because developers are very optimistic.

523
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:51,147
developers go, I will definitely, definitely have this finished in two weeks.

524
00:34:51,147 --> 00:34:57,212
No problem. And then two weeks later, big problem.

525
00:34:57,212 --> 00:35:03,117
So make sure that you're factoring in time for everything to go wrong.

526
00:35:04,574 --> 00:35:08,976
Just speaking to Ed a moment ago, and he was like saying,

527
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:11,858
every time you do it, factor in 50% extra time.

528
00:35:11,858 --> 00:35:14,499
And I would say, that is conservative.

529
00:35:14,499 --> 00:35:16,020
Usually it's like twice.

530
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,861
That's what I would always say.

531
00:35:17,861 --> 00:35:19,842
If you've got a budget, though.

532
00:35:19,842 --> 00:35:20,622
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

533
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:21,262
If you've got a budget.

534
00:35:21,262 --> 00:35:23,403
No one ever has budget for that.

535
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:24,424
No one ever has budget.

536
00:35:24,424 --> 00:35:24,964
I know.

537
00:35:24,964 --> 00:35:27,766
But make sure that you're factoring in the fact

538
00:35:27,766 --> 00:35:29,987
that something will go wrong.

539
00:35:29,987 --> 00:35:31,748
Because it will. 100%.

540
00:35:31,748 --> 00:35:33,488
I have never seen a game.

541
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:40,151
where something hasn't gone wrong at some point.

542
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:42,211
So yeah, nothing ever goes exactly according to plan,

543
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:43,991
so schedule some flexibility.

544
00:35:43,991 --> 00:35:47,392
Do not screw up your launch date.

545
00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:52,033
Your launch date, once you announce it to the public,

546
00:35:52,033 --> 00:35:55,013
if you mess it up, people do not forgive

547
00:35:55,013 --> 00:35:59,854
and they do not forget, especially on Steam.

548
00:35:59,854 --> 00:36:02,655
Like, Steam community is,

549
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:08,888
There's a video camera, so I'm not going to say that.

550
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:12,469
But the Steam community is definitely a tricky, tricky

551
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:13,669
place to navigate.

552
00:36:13,669 --> 00:36:18,130
And consumers on the Steam platform have a very high

553
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,250
opinion of what they deserve.

554
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,551
And you have to be very, very careful with that.

555
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:26,891
Because the last thing you want to do is to launch with

556
00:36:26,891 --> 00:36:27,851
controversy already.

557
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:31,012
I know developers who postponed their launch date by

558
00:36:31,012 --> 00:36:35,133
a week or two weeks and got review bombed on launch.

559
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:35,713
You know?

560
00:36:36,718 --> 00:36:42,119
It's a sad and ugly situation, but it happens and you need to be prepared for it.

561
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,280
Be realistic.

562
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:54,562
What I will say is, if you have a two year development schedule, don't copy what's popular now.

563
00:36:54,562 --> 00:37:01,044
Because what's popular right now will not be popular in two years.

564
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:03,905
You try selling a battle royale game in two years.

565
00:37:04,669 --> 00:37:09,772
Like, the market is going to be absolutely flooded with them by people who can put them

566
00:37:09,772 --> 00:37:11,593
out way faster than you can.

567
00:37:11,593 --> 00:37:17,036
So if your goal is to do an indie battle royale, you need to have a six month turnaround time,

568
00:37:17,036 --> 00:37:19,237
or you need to look for a different idea.

569
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:24,480
Otherwise you're just going to run out of space in the market.

570
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,721
And watch the market.

571
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:32,564
If you see things going in a particular direction, do not be afraid to update your game.

572
00:37:33,643 --> 00:37:36,764
Have any of you seen a video game called Not Tonight?

573
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:40,366
You obviously know it because you're British.

574
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:47,308
So Not Tonight was originally a bouncer simulator, so it was about nightclubs.

575
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:53,269
And it was about a bouncer who would let you into nightclubs or not let you into nightclubs.

576
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:55,850
Then in the UK, Brexit happened.

577
00:37:57,012 --> 00:38:01,856
and they changed the whole game to be about Brexit.

578
00:38:01,856 --> 00:38:05,339
After Brexit, it'll be the end of the world

579
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:08,341
and this is a bartender, sorry, this is a bouncer

580
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:13,405
who is kind of guarding these bars at the end of the world.

581
00:38:13,405 --> 00:38:15,787
And everybody fucking loved it.

582
00:38:15,787 --> 00:38:19,670
Like, people bought so many copies of it.

583
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,131
Like, that game is making bank

584
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:25,474
because they noticed that there was this place

585
00:38:25,474 --> 00:38:26,295
in the market.

586
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:31,210
and they knew, they said, hey, in order to do this, all we need to do is just redo our

587
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:31,930
art assets.

588
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:38,772
It's a pain in the arse, but we can redo our art assets and we can capture this moment.

589
00:38:38,772 --> 00:38:39,992
You know what I mean?

590
00:38:39,992 --> 00:38:41,272
We can be relevant.

591
00:38:41,272 --> 00:38:44,713
And being relevant and on time is so hard.

592
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:49,694
So be aware, watch the market, figure out what's going on.

593
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:54,255
If you are releasing a game about saving a princess, you are fucking mad.

594
00:38:54,985 --> 00:39:00,568
Because that ship has sailed. Everyone is sick of this dynamic.

595
00:39:00,568 --> 00:39:05,290
If you are releasing a game about a heroic, strong man doing something for a girl,

596
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:07,511
fucking watch the news.

597
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,892
Read some games journalism.

598
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:13,894
See what people are actually writing about, what people are getting excited about.

599
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:15,154
It's not that.

600
00:39:15,154 --> 00:39:21,537
And the amount of time that I spend with developers who have got good games...

601
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:26,998
with just a terrible concept behind it

602
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:31,923
is unbelievably, unbelievably common.

603
00:39:31,923 --> 00:39:38,108
Find a niche or find something that is in the zeitgeist,

604
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:39,910
in now, and go for it.

605
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:45,435
And I just added the Mandarin comment.

606
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:56,203
And actually, that's it. I'm done.

607
00:39:56,203 --> 00:40:01,605
So, does anybody have any questions? I like questions.

608
00:40:01,605 --> 00:40:14,592
About getting informed and all the sites or Indies should follow other than Otaku and the Tama Sutra and...

609
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:19,975
What other sites do you recommend?

610
00:40:19,975 --> 00:40:21,216
Stay in touch with what...

611
00:40:23,238 --> 00:40:30,863
Yeah, so I mean for staying in touch, you know the best place to stay in touch with what's going on in the world?

612
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:31,944
Is Twitter.

613
00:40:31,944 --> 00:40:34,846
And I know that Twitter is an absolute nightmare.

614
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:35,987
It is a hell site.

615
00:40:35,987 --> 00:40:38,088
But, people

616
00:40:40,153 --> 00:40:45,617
are following all of the game developers on Twitter, that's what I did. So I started up

617
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:54,224
a Twitter like four years ago and I just followed every game developer I could think of and

618
00:40:54,224 --> 00:40:58,727
every games journalist I could think of. I just went through a list, I went through every

619
00:40:58,727 --> 00:41:04,271
website and I followed them all. And now, if you scroll through it, you get a really

620
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:07,934
good idea of what people are writing about.

621
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:12,920
right now people are really interested in games that have social commentary.

622
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:19,385
People are really interested in games that have, you know, that are sort of doing something new

623
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:26,411
with the genre. Not necessarily completely different styles of game, but games that have

624
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:30,574
some different content, if you get what I mean. So what we are doing, so one of the games that

625
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:36,318
we just signed in the last couple of weeks, is a 2D platforming game.

626
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:44,646
about a young girl going on an adventure in the local culture that she's from. So the

627
00:41:44,646 --> 00:41:50,110
game developer is Southeast Asian, so it's all about Southeast Asian culture and mythology.

628
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:55,294
And we're pretty confident that's going to hit some nerves. We're pretty confident that

629
00:41:55,294 --> 00:42:02,058
we're going to get some resonance, just because it's not a crazy new type of game, but we

630
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:08,620
Or that people will find interesting

631
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:17,043
Because a lot of Americans don't know anything about Southeast Asian mythology

632
00:42:17,043 --> 00:42:25,767
So that type of stuff is cool

633
00:42:25,767 --> 00:42:26,387
Does that help answer?

634
00:42:26,387 --> 00:42:26,507
Yeah

635
00:42:26,507 --> 00:42:27,507
Cool, any other questions?

636
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:27,887
Come on

637
00:42:27,887 --> 00:42:27,947
有問題嗎?

638
00:42:27,947 --> 00:42:28,848
我跟他加碼一下好了

639
00:42:29,712 --> 00:42:33,555
那個...等一下如果有提問的人可以來找我這邊登記

640
00:42:33,555 --> 00:42:37,879
我這邊有三組前幾天才發售的

641
00:42:37,879 --> 00:42:41,021
就是 Paper Sprees 那個作者他後來發的新遊戲的Pee

642
00:42:41,021 --> 00:42:42,602
我有三組Pee

643
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:43,963
所以就是...

644
00:42:43,963 --> 00:42:48,247
有提問的人等一下可以來找我拿Pee

645
00:42:56,787 --> 00:43:03,410
But I was wondering, don't you feel it's like nowadays, press is less and less important

646
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:09,912
and community is taking over because nobody really pays any attention to what those journalists

647
00:43:09,912 --> 00:43:14,574
are saying and maybe in 3, 4, 5 years, community will be all like Discord and other means.

648
00:43:14,574 --> 00:43:15,374
You are 100% correct.

649
00:43:15,374 --> 00:43:22,957
So with our most recent game that launched, SINNER, if you actually look at the reviews,

650
00:43:22,957 --> 00:43:23,778
they're not that good.

651
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:30,791
We got about 6 out of 10 is our average score for Sinner, which is not terrible, but it's not great either.

652
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:32,672
But our sales are pretty good.

653
00:43:32,672 --> 00:43:37,595
And our sales are pretty good because we have a really really passionate community that's gone out there

654
00:43:37,595 --> 00:43:45,439
and they've told their friends and they've pushed their favorite streamers and their favorite streamers played it and the streamers like it because they're

655
00:43:45,439 --> 00:43:47,980
in that type of community and

656
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:53,503
Yeah, so you are 100% correct. I suspect that within the next kind of few years we're going to see

657
00:43:54,269 --> 00:43:57,010
games, journalism, become more and more niche.

658
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:01,332
So it'll still have a place, it'll always have a place in the same way that, like,

659
00:44:01,332 --> 00:44:04,173
book critics have a place, you know what I mean?

660
00:44:04,173 --> 00:44:06,795
I read book critics because I'm a f***ing nerd, but

661
00:44:06,795 --> 00:44:13,158
it's certainly not the most common way to learn about books.

662
00:44:13,158 --> 00:44:17,460
What do you think about the multi-tiered thing?

663
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,401
The first layer is always about getting

664
00:44:20,401 --> 00:44:22,742
the words out first.

665
00:44:23,318 --> 00:44:28,201
people may not like your game or they may not buy your game on site.

666
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:37,286
Maybe they read about it from some Facebook pages or some bloggers or other journalists,

667
00:44:37,286 --> 00:44:43,990
but then you try to get their awareness out, and then some people who are interested

668
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:47,292
will try to dig into more information afterwards.

669
00:44:47,292 --> 00:44:50,354
Yeah, that's basically the funnel, right?

670
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,135
So for me...

671
00:44:51,941 --> 00:44:59,797
Every single thing that we do now, the end result is to get them in my Discord.

672
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:02,162
Like, everything I do is to get them in one place.

673
00:45:17,308 --> 00:45:25,994
But it's like, you know, you've got to check with the moderators to make sure it's okay to promote your thing and whatever.

674
00:45:25,994 --> 00:45:28,396
Yeah, I'll be sneaky, I'll be sneaky. Sneaky's fine.

675
00:45:28,396 --> 00:45:29,277
Just polite about it.

676
00:45:29,277 --> 00:45:29,937
Yeah, politely sneaky.

677
00:45:29,937 --> 00:45:34,760
But like, have you got any other advice for, like, getting those people in the funnel?

678
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:41,225
So my number one advice is wherever you are, find the gamers here.

679
00:45:42,023 --> 00:45:46,827
like for example if you're in like Taiwan has a fucking amazing gaming community

680
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:52,693
like actually crazy passionate gaming community and very supportive

681
00:45:52,693 --> 00:45:56,577
so if you can tap into the Taiwanese gaming community

682
00:45:56,577 --> 00:45:58,759
you already have a head start

683
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:03,763
so if you live in a city where you have say

684
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:08,033
gamer meetups and gamer things, just use your phone.

685
00:46:08,033 --> 00:46:11,215
Go on that meetup app, look at the game stuff,

686
00:46:11,215 --> 00:46:13,617
go to those people, get them to play your games,

687
00:46:13,617 --> 00:46:15,879
get them to sign up for your Discord.

688
00:46:15,879 --> 00:46:16,539
That's the start.

689
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:20,122
I mean, once you've got 100 people, you have a start,

690
00:46:20,122 --> 00:46:22,504
and you can get 100, if your game is good

691
00:46:22,504 --> 00:46:24,205
and you are going out there,

692
00:46:24,205 --> 00:46:25,406
you can get 100 people, no problem.

693
00:46:25,406 --> 00:46:29,149
And once you get 100 people, you can start going further.

694
00:46:29,149 --> 00:46:31,691
And then when you're talking with

695
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:44,068
what's the interest like? You can say, hey, I've got this discord, it's not big, but look

696
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:55,230
at how crazy passionate these people are. And I've got zero marketing budget, but I've

697
00:46:55,230 --> 00:47:02,852
got 100 people who are loving my game already. That has weight. That has weight.

698
00:47:03,259 --> 00:47:09,364
Unless your name is already known, otherwise you usually have to start pretty small.

699
00:47:09,364 --> 00:47:19,391
You get a few streamers that are pretty light on content, they don't have many things to talk about,

700
00:47:19,391 --> 00:47:28,978
but you get the smaller ones, these guys interested, and then some of the bigger ones, like big guns, will come later.

701
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:36,980
streams or twitch streams about this game and then maybe I

702
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:42,561
Can like I see the interest there, so I'll try to follow up this small streamer

703
00:47:42,561 --> 00:47:49,183
Yeah, so like this kind of progression. Do you see that in in press as well like are there any?

704
00:47:49,183 --> 00:47:53,244
Not in press in streamers definitely

705
00:47:53,482 --> 00:47:58,023
Like, in streamers, if you get enough smaller streamers playing your game, then medium streamers

706
00:47:58,023 --> 00:48:02,124
play your game, and then enough medium streamers play your game, then bigger streamers play

707
00:48:02,124 --> 00:48:02,304
your game.

708
00:48:02,304 --> 00:48:04,025
In press, I don't see that.

709
00:48:04,025 --> 00:48:08,786
It tends to be the other way around, that you hit the top and it filters down, or you

710
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:09,926
just stay at the bottom.

711
00:48:09,926 --> 00:48:14,267
I say this from experience of being one of those guys at the bottom.

712
00:48:14,732 --> 00:48:24,378
So yeah, I don't think press is the same way, but what I will say is there's almost no influencer too small.

713
00:48:24,378 --> 00:48:35,805
So one of the things that we did, I think, very effectively was we targeted influencers who had like 1,000 followers or less on their given platforms.

714
00:48:35,805 --> 00:48:43,630
And we hit them hard and were like, hey, come join the Discord, hey, join our creator lounge, join our people doing this, that and the other.

715
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:51,113
those people got involved, those people were super passionate, and it had the knock-on effect.

716
00:48:51,113 --> 00:48:57,756
So even with the Sinner launch, where we had the big Dark Souls streamers playing Sinner,

717
00:48:57,756 --> 00:49:04,099
we also went into all of the smaller lounges with like 70 people watching, or 80 people watching,

718
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:09,062
or 30 people watching, and just said, hey man, thanks for playing our game,

719
00:49:09,062 --> 00:49:13,043
if you've got any questions you can follow up here, or you can join the Discord.

720
00:49:14,088 --> 00:49:19,630
And we got loads of people joining our Discord from just that little message.

721
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:25,471
Just sort of like thanking people for their interest, interacting with people.

722
00:49:25,471 --> 00:49:27,452
It makes a big difference.

723
00:49:27,452 --> 00:49:34,114
Like I said, if you want to build a community, Twitter's a really good place to start to

724
00:49:34,114 --> 00:49:38,675
figure out what's going on and a good place to reach out to people directly.

725
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,136
But, and put them somewhere.

726
00:49:41,136 --> 00:49:42,797
I always recommend Discord because...

727
00:49:43,285 --> 00:49:51,829
I can love Discord, but they also just gave me a shitload of money, so I'm very biased.

728
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:55,171
But I really, really, really strongly recommend Discord.

729
00:49:55,171 --> 00:49:57,332
I can't think of another platform that works as well.

730
00:49:57,332 --> 00:50:02,855
Speaking about Discord, nowadays there's new upcoming stores in Kodak City.

731
00:50:02,855 --> 00:50:03,875
I know, that's how I got my money.

732
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,116
There's God, there's...

733
00:50:14,744 --> 00:50:22,747
get money. If your game, if somebody passionately wants your game, then they need to pay for

734
00:50:22,747 --> 00:50:29,490
it. And if you can get some kind of exclusivity deal, do it, because guaranteed money in 2018

735
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:41,415
is just unbelievably important. But none of these stores have even a fraction of the impact

736
00:50:41,415 --> 00:50:41,755
of Steam.

737
00:50:42,476 --> 00:50:45,358
Like, you know, I think that the biggest one is Gorg,

738
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:50,020
which is like, what, 4%, 5% of Steam?

739
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,901
Itches after that with 2% to 3%.

740
00:50:51,901 --> 00:50:54,063
Discord's not even on the map yet.

741
00:50:54,063 --> 00:50:54,263
So,

742
00:50:54,263 --> 00:51:03,068
expending time, energy, and resources on these other stores,

743
00:51:03,068 --> 00:51:05,529
it's tough to say it's worth your time,

744
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:06,990
unless they're offering something.

745
00:51:07,437 --> 00:51:13,301
And never ever ever ever ever fall for people saying I offer you exposure.

746
00:51:13,301 --> 00:51:17,543
Because it's the most common thing that they'll say.

747
00:51:17,543 --> 00:51:22,887
Yeah, they'll say, give us your game on launch, do all this stuff.

748
00:51:22,887 --> 00:51:26,729
And it's always a hassle, because everyone's got their own tax shit,

749
00:51:26,729 --> 00:51:31,752
and everyone's got their own paperwork, and then you need to put someone in charge of it.

750
00:51:31,752 --> 00:51:35,054
Look how tired Frank is.

751
00:51:35,054 --> 00:51:36,335
And then you get nothing from it.

752
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:41,655
我們的Steam賣出會是5000-10000個月

753
00:51:41,655 --> 00:51:43,916
這些其他店鋪你加起來是200-300個月

754
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:46,077
那些是有好的遊戲,那些沒有好的遊戲

755
00:51:46,077 --> 00:51:48,198
他們不會賣任何東西

756
00:51:48,198 --> 00:51:49,778
所以我的建議是

757
00:51:49,778 --> 00:51:52,999
如果有一個想要你的遊戲的新平台

758
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:55,820
他們就需要去做

759
00:52:12,183 --> 00:52:16,227
我想問一個跟時間有關的問題,大家聽一下好了

760
00:52:37,473 --> 00:52:41,314
probably the thing that I see kill the most indie games

761
00:52:41,314 --> 00:52:44,716
is just that nobody does anything other than develop their game.

762
00:52:44,716 --> 00:52:52,779
And so they're developing, developing, developing, developing, developing, and then they launch it,

763
00:52:52,779 --> 00:52:56,621
and then nobody pays any attention, and they go,

764
00:52:56,621 --> 00:52:58,302
oh, well that's over then.

765
00:52:58,302 --> 00:53:00,303
Like, that's that. And that's tragic.

766
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:01,723
Like, that's really sad.

767
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:03,504
Yeah, so this brings me to, like,

768
00:53:03,504 --> 00:53:05,985
because most of these people here are developers, and

769
00:53:05,985 --> 00:53:06,225
your

770
00:53:07,844 --> 00:53:18,412
The schedule you talked about looks like it's kind of like when they're working on their own, the schedule looks like this.

771
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:20,654
But what happens if they work with a publisher like you?

772
00:53:20,654 --> 00:53:28,079
Or maybe, what kind of completeness do they have to be in when they're trying to get a good result?

773
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:35,585
I mean, for example, if you're working with a publisher, then the publisher deals with everything.

774
00:53:43,123 --> 00:53:46,944
the development that I just described, then you haven't got a good publisher.

775
00:53:46,944 --> 00:53:49,705
In terms of trailers, do you outsource making of trailers? Who are some of the good companies

776
00:53:49,705 --> 00:53:50,765
to outsource trailers?

777
00:53:50,765 --> 00:53:56,326
So we've done a mix. We've done stuff in-house, depending on the developers and depending

778
00:53:56,326 --> 00:54:01,968
on their skill set. So we've had some nice trailers made in-house. We've had one trailer

779
00:54:01,968 --> 00:54:10,170
made by a gentleman called Josh. I can't remember his surname. If you reach out to me, I can

780
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:11,090
give it to you.

781
00:54:11,517 --> 00:54:16,241
He does very good 2D trailers. Did you know the game That Dragon Cancer?

782
00:54:16,241 --> 00:54:22,106
He's the guy that did the trailer for that, you know the trailer that made everyone cry?

783
00:54:22,106 --> 00:54:27,991
He did that trailer. So he's a really talented guy, and he did one of our trailers.

784
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:31,453
And for Sinner we got a guy from Japan called Gavin.

785
00:54:31,453 --> 00:54:35,657
And he did our Sinner trailers, which are crazy cinematic.

786
00:54:35,657 --> 00:54:39,240
Like, I still don't understand how we afforded him, because he was far too good.

787
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:46,671
There's a really good guy called Eric Liu

788
00:54:46,671 --> 00:54:48,652
Yeah I know Eric, yeah yeah yeah

789
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:52,393
Who is American but he has a...

790
00:54:52,393 --> 00:54:57,874
He's a trailer editor and he has a newsletter that goes out every Sunday

791
00:54:57,874 --> 00:55:01,955
Like with different topics like editing trailers

792
00:55:01,955 --> 00:55:04,256
So if you want to learn how to do your own trailer

793
00:55:04,256 --> 00:55:07,197
If you can't afford someone else to do it then...

794
00:55:07,197 --> 00:55:09,317
Yes, so Eric Liu, right? L-I-U

795
00:55:09,317 --> 00:55:10,038
Derek!

796
00:55:10,038 --> 00:55:13,178
I've met, I've met because he's friends with Josh

797
00:55:13,904 --> 00:55:16,945
So I met them both together.

798
00:55:16,945 --> 00:55:18,745
Derek Liu. L-I-U.

799
00:55:18,745 --> 00:55:19,626
Yes. L-I-U.

800
00:55:19,626 --> 00:55:29,329
We can, we can, I'll put it in the presentation, I'll send the presentation to Josh.

801
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:29,489
Josh?

802
00:55:29,489 --> 00:55:30,049
Yeah.

803
00:55:30,049 --> 00:55:31,969
Anyone else?

804
00:55:31,969 --> 00:55:32,049
Hey!

805
00:55:32,049 --> 00:55:32,690
A new one.

806
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:35,170
A sponsoring, yeah.

807
00:55:43,607 --> 00:55:47,851
I mean if you've already launched your game for a year, it's an uphill struggle to do

808
00:55:47,851 --> 00:55:49,092
anything with media.

809
00:55:49,092 --> 00:55:54,377
Like you are going to struggle really hard to get media attention unless you do something

810
00:55:54,377 --> 00:55:54,838
crazy.

811
00:55:54,838 --> 00:56:00,443
Like unless you have some update that like blows everybody away.

812
00:56:00,443 --> 00:56:03,966
But if you are building a community, then absolutely.

813
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:12,265
start pinging people, hey I liked your game, my game is similar, see what happens, start

814
00:56:12,265 --> 00:56:18,390
a conversation with the developers, get them interested, and just start building that community.

815
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:22,214
It's totally possible to build a community based around an older game, especially if

816
00:56:22,214 --> 00:56:26,497
you're fine with essentially giving away copies of that game for free.

817
00:56:26,497 --> 00:56:32,682
I know it's always painful to do, but I assure you that giving away copies of your game for

818
00:56:32,682 --> 00:56:33,183
free...

819
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:45,957
to build a community will benefit you more in the long run than selling your game for

820
00:56:45,957 --> 00:56:59,666
25 cents on a bundle. So if you have the choice between doing those two things, build your

821
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:03,048
community. No problem.

822
00:57:05,995 --> 00:57:20,666
If you're launching your game anywhere close to the summer, winter, or occasionally spring, when they do their spring sale occasionally, then you're fucked.

823
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:26,831
There's just no way that you will get any attention because everybody's buying games for $2.

824
00:57:26,831 --> 00:57:35,278
It's one of the reasons why I've become most unhappy with Steam, is the discount culture.

825
00:57:35,782 --> 00:57:40,904
I think discount culture on Steam has had a really detrimental effect.

826
00:57:40,904 --> 00:57:42,684
And that's a worry.

827
00:57:42,684 --> 00:57:46,666
How long should we leave for?

828
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:49,087
I would say at least two weeks.

829
00:57:49,087 --> 00:57:50,988
At least two weeks.

830
00:57:50,988 --> 00:57:53,889
Three to four would be better.

831
00:57:53,889 --> 00:57:59,931
About the launch day, I want to follow up the launch day question.

832
00:57:59,931 --> 00:58:00,792
Because...

833
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:08,263
Nowadays they say there are already no good lunch date in a whole year.

834
00:58:08,263 --> 00:58:14,787
No matter on what day you lunch, on what weekend, on what vacation, it's just bad.

835
00:58:14,787 --> 00:58:17,709
But there are different levels of bad.

836
00:58:17,709 --> 00:58:20,290
Yeah, there are definitely.

837
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:26,674
Don't launch on Christmas, that would be a bad idea.

838
00:58:26,674 --> 00:58:30,296
25th of December, bad launch day.

839
00:58:30,296 --> 00:58:32,398
In your experience, do you have...

840
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,651
A few windows per year?

841
00:58:34,651 --> 00:58:40,273
It depends on the title as well, so it's kind of difficult to give a generic...

842
00:58:40,273 --> 00:58:40,593
I see.

843
00:58:40,593 --> 00:58:43,274
This day is good because it depends on what's coming out.

844
00:58:43,274 --> 00:58:47,856
So actually, our Sinner launch date should have been terrible.

845
00:58:47,856 --> 00:58:52,157
We ended up with this launch date because everything aligned and ended up...

846
00:58:52,157 --> 00:59:00,320
We actually launched Sinner, which is a Souls-like game on Switch the day before Dark Souls.

847
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:07,192
So when I say we all fuck up scheduling, we all fuck up scheduling.

848
00:59:07,192 --> 00:59:11,994
But we were lucky enough that our community pushed us through.

849
00:59:11,994 --> 00:59:16,075
No, there's no good time, I don't think.

850
00:59:16,075 --> 00:59:19,997
There's no time that you can look at and go, that's a good time.

851
00:59:19,997 --> 00:59:26,419
If I had to put money on a place right now, I'd say quarter one is probably the better time.

852
00:59:26,419 --> 00:59:33,102
It used to always be that January, February was considered to be a bad time to launch games.

853
00:59:33,923 --> 00:59:42,346
But that just means there's not that many games launching in January, February, and that's basically what good means now.

854
00:59:42,346 --> 00:59:52,710
Like, when can you launch your game at a time where there's going to be less people launching their games? That's it.

855
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:58,372
So January, February, even early March is probably like my ideal window, but...

856
00:59:58,372 --> 01:00:02,334
I don't know, is my honest answer. It depends on the title, depends what else is coming out.

857
01:00:02,888 --> 01:00:04,530
There's a lot of factors.

858
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:07,914
How do you follow up some of the,

859
01:00:07,914 --> 01:00:10,477
like I want to avoid in conflict with some type of games

860
01:00:10,477 --> 01:00:14,802
that they have super big titles that's coming out

861
01:00:14,802 --> 01:00:16,544
maybe on one market.

862
01:00:16,544 --> 01:00:18,767
How do you, yeah, like how do you?

863
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,221
You know something, sometimes it can't be avoided.

864
01:00:22,221 --> 01:00:25,202
Like sometimes you have the perfect launch day

865
01:00:25,202 --> 01:00:26,922
and you've got everything set up

866
01:00:26,922 --> 01:00:29,043
and then you just get fucked by a surprise launch

867
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:32,583
or the week before somebody changes it.

868
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:33,884
This happened with us.

869
01:00:33,884 --> 01:00:35,984
So we had a game that launched

870
01:00:35,984 --> 01:00:39,565
and on the same day that we launched our game,

871
01:00:39,565 --> 01:00:42,006
which was like a cute indie game,

872
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:43,906
Mike Bithell launched his...

873
01:00:45,101 --> 01:00:50,085
surprise indie game that everyone was like,

874
01:00:50,085 --> 01:00:55,270
Oh my god, Mike Bithell launched a new game! Woo!

875
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:58,072
So my game just like went from the rankings from like, woo!

876
01:00:58,072 --> 01:01:01,555
I sent him a very, very bitter tweet.

877
01:01:01,555 --> 01:01:04,157
Mike, give me some notice, you bastard!

878
01:01:04,157 --> 01:01:05,178
But yeah, it happens.

879
01:01:05,178 --> 01:01:11,664
That is the one thing that I always say to developers,

880
01:01:11,664 --> 01:01:12,524
prepare to fail.

881
01:01:13,672 --> 01:01:20,155
I know that's a horrible thing to hear, but if you get yourself in a situation where your

882
01:01:20,155 --> 01:01:26,638
life is going to be destroyed by making your game, stop making your game.

883
01:01:26,638 --> 01:01:27,258
Go get a job.

884
01:01:27,258 --> 01:01:29,359
Like, go work in 7-Eleven.

885
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:35,122
Like, don't fucking, don't, don't get yourself in debt, don't mortgage your house.

886
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:40,082
Don't get money from your parents that you can't pay back.

887
01:01:40,082 --> 01:01:43,983
All of this stuff is a big no-no. Right now,

888
01:01:43,983 --> 01:01:47,024
most games do not make money.

889
01:01:47,024 --> 01:01:49,845
That's a fact. So you have to factor it in.

890
01:01:49,845 --> 01:01:55,267
If you can't factor it in, don't.

891
01:01:55,267 --> 01:01:58,688
The days of, give it a go, it'll be fine, are over.

892
01:01:58,688 --> 01:02:01,049
Is it long over? Yeah. We're back on time.

893
01:02:01,853 --> 01:02:06,394
Especially, I mean, like, Steam has been over since Greenlight came out.

894
01:02:06,394 --> 01:02:10,795
But people just didn't realize for like four years.

895
01:02:10,795 --> 01:02:15,576
Everyone was like, oh, everyone's making money right now.

896
01:02:15,576 --> 01:02:16,816
We're all poor.

897
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:19,097
Everyone's starving.

898
01:02:19,097 --> 01:02:22,358
So that's a happy thing to think about.

899
01:02:22,358 --> 01:02:25,678
I have one last question about scheduling, because...

900
01:02:27,676 --> 01:02:33,740
the final preparation, like your launch or the final strategy of your development, you

901
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:36,662
are also considering going to shows.

902
01:02:36,662 --> 01:02:37,062
Yes.

903
01:02:37,062 --> 01:02:40,905
Conferences or festivals, shows.

904
01:02:40,905 --> 01:02:45,848
So how do you kind of factor that in?

905
01:02:45,848 --> 01:02:48,810
So the way...

906
01:02:50,086 --> 01:02:54,831
I know that for me it's a good idea to go to shows because I've been building those

907
01:02:54,831 --> 01:03:00,376
relationships for the last four years by going every year to all of these shows and because

908
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:07,003
I've built those relationships, I... so for example, with Cynna we did the Discord deal

909
01:03:07,003 --> 01:03:08,625
and we did Xbox Games Pass.

910
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:13,250
I can't tell you how much money we made off that, but we broke even on Cynna before we

911
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:13,890
sold a contract.

912
01:03:15,307 --> 01:03:21,668
And I got those deals because I went to those shows, I shook those hands, I met those people.

913
01:03:21,668 --> 01:03:27,110
I got my first dev kit because at GDC I got drunk and I sat on somebody from Nintendo.

914
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:30,010
That's how I got my first Nintendo dev kit.

915
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:32,891
I sat on the European director of Nintendo.

916
01:03:32,891 --> 01:03:35,032
And he was like sitting on a man.

917
01:03:35,032 --> 01:03:37,052
Excuse me, I went, whoa!

918
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:40,033
That's how I got my Nintendo Switch dev kit.

919
01:03:45,158 --> 01:03:54,100
So yeah, for me as a publisher, it's also good because I always have new stuff.

920
01:03:54,100 --> 01:04:00,642
You know what I mean? I'm always going there with fresh stuff, with new things to talk about.

921
01:04:00,642 --> 01:04:06,763
As developers, individual developers, I think showcasing is really, really risky.

922
01:04:06,763 --> 01:04:13,645
It's so expensive and it takes so long to build those connections.

923
01:04:14,089 --> 01:04:19,352
The only reason why I was able to build those connections was because I did GDC, I did PAX

924
01:04:19,352 --> 01:04:23,715
East, I did PAX West, I did PAX Australia, I did anything else.

925
01:04:23,715 --> 01:04:26,737
I did EGX in the UK, I did Rezd in the UK.

926
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:31,081
I basically spent six months travelling for two years.

927
01:04:31,081 --> 01:04:32,381
Three years, God, three years.

928
01:04:32,381 --> 01:04:34,223
That was a long three years.

929
01:04:35,825 --> 01:04:50,057
Most of you can't do that. Most of you don't want to do that. It's horrible. You smell really bad most of the time.

930
01:04:50,057 --> 01:04:50,977
It's gross.

931
01:04:50,977 --> 01:04:53,880
So for me it made sense, but for individual developers...

932
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,261
It's dangerous.

933
01:04:55,261 --> 01:05:00,305
You can very, very, very, very easily spend crazy amounts of money.

934
01:05:00,305 --> 01:05:02,127
I mean, going to America is expensive.

935
01:05:02,656 --> 01:05:07,497
The flights are expensive, staying there is expensive, eating there is expensive.

936
01:05:07,497 --> 01:05:12,278
You guys are lucky because you guys don't need a visa.

937
01:05:12,278 --> 01:05:18,019
But I mean, for most of the people in this part of the world, even getting a visa is expensive.

938
01:05:18,019 --> 01:05:23,180
So, it's tough for me to say it's a good idea.

939
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:28,441
I always say, if you have the resources and it's not going to kill you, do it.

940
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:35,462
If you're on a budget and you're kind of weighing between like, oh well, do I spend my money

941
01:05:35,462 --> 01:05:41,587
on developing the game and building the community and doing all the stuff I mentioned, or going

942
01:05:41,587 --> 01:05:45,810
to GDC, fucking stay home.

943
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:48,152
Watch that shit on YouTube!

944
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:52,856
You know, the information doesn't get bad because you get it a few months later and

945
01:05:52,856 --> 01:05:56,278
someone's always got a vault password if you ask nicely.

946
01:05:57,433 --> 01:06:01,395
So yeah, don't kill yourself to do stuff like that. It's fun.

947
01:06:01,395 --> 01:06:07,779
Every developer should do it once as an experience. It's like going to Mecca.

948
01:06:07,779 --> 01:06:13,583
But you shouldn't be doing it if it's gonna hurt you.

949
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:18,126
So you have a very clear idea about why you are doing this trip.

950
01:06:18,126 --> 01:06:23,329
Yeah, exactly. So for us, with some of our games now, we're helping them come with us.

951
01:06:27,605 --> 01:06:31,887
and we'll pay for the booth, you know what I mean?

952
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:36,250
So suddenly, all the developer's paying for

953
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:39,892
is their accommodation and their food.

954
01:06:39,892 --> 01:06:41,413
Hooray, bargain, good job.

955
01:06:41,413 --> 01:06:45,016
But if you're not in that situation,

956
01:06:45,016 --> 01:06:48,378
you're paying for everything on your own,

957
01:06:48,378 --> 01:06:50,259
holy shit, it's expensive.

958
01:06:50,259 --> 01:06:51,460
Like we spend 20 to 40,000 US dollars a year on showcasing?

959
01:06:57,102 --> 01:06:58,584
So yeah.

960
01:06:58,584 --> 01:07:00,646
Any other questions?

961
01:07:00,646 --> 01:07:01,948
Anyone? Questions?

962
01:07:01,948 --> 01:07:03,750
We're running out of time.

963
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:06,232
If you have any questions,

964
01:07:06,232 --> 01:07:08,815
you can ask them in private.

965
01:07:08,815 --> 01:07:09,476
My Twitter is...

966
01:07:09,476 --> 01:07:13,300
Ah, I've lost it.

967
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:13,521
There we go.

968
01:07:13,521 --> 01:07:15,523
My Twitter is there,

969
01:07:15,523 --> 01:07:17,365
at Memlock87.

970
01:07:19,345 --> 01:07:28,271
follow me. I make terrible jokes, I post pictures of my dogs and I talk about video games.

971
01:07:28,271 --> 01:07:36,117
And if you have any questions at all, you can always contact me. You can DM me, my DMs

972
01:07:36,117 --> 01:07:41,000
are open, so if you don't want to contact me in public, you don't have to. And I just

973
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,324
realised I didn't put the Discord link up there. Amazing. Amazing. Let's fix that.

974
01:07:46,828 --> 01:07:52,693
And just underneath my Twitter handle is the Discord link.

975
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:54,674
So that's discord.gg slash AI.

976
01:07:54,674 --> 01:08:04,401
And you should definitely come and join my community and become part of my...

977
01:08:04,401 --> 01:08:04,821
Not cult.

978
01:08:04,821 --> 01:08:06,683
A group of friendship.

979
01:08:06,683 --> 01:08:07,763
But yeah.

980
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:12,595
Yeah, and any questions, anything at all, you can always contact me.

981
01:08:12,595 --> 01:08:18,764
I am very very keen on supporting Taiwanese development and developers.

982
01:08:18,764 --> 01:08:21,688
So just let me know, okay?

983
01:08:21,688 --> 01:08:21,909
Cool.

984
01:08:21,909 --> 01:08:22,590
Are we done?

985
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:23,931
OK, 那我們掌聲歡迎,再感謝一次Ian。
