1
00:00:00,805 --> 00:00:03,206
OK, let's actually get started.

2
00:00:03,206 --> 00:00:05,928
OK, part 2 of pitching marathon.

3
00:00:05,928 --> 00:00:09,510
好,那就是我們上一場是專門講針對發行商的提案

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:21,797
So this one is titled how to pitch to your team, but you might also call it should I really make this game?

5
00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:26,320
對,那這個主題雖然表面上是寫說如何提案給你的團隊

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,621
那其實你可以把它想像成說

7
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:31,476
Should you make this game or not?

8
00:00:58,706 --> 00:01:02,288
what the genre is, what they expect the gameplay experience

9
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:05,110
would be like.

10
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,131
If you have a demo, that's great,

11
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:13,415
because then already you can get people experience the emotions

12
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:14,596
that you want them to experience.

13
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:16,137
But otherwise, you have to explain it.

14
00:01:16,137 --> 00:01:18,598
And then you put a little bit about your team.

15
00:01:18,598 --> 00:01:21,260
So you do all that.

16
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:26,409
就是基本上這段跟就是剛剛Ed講到的內容

17
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:29,372
其實算是重複性是蠻高的

18
00:01:29,372 --> 00:01:33,117
就基本上一個Pitch你就算不是對發行商做

19
00:01:33,117 --> 00:01:35,259
那基本上你會要的要素

20
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:36,681
就是像簡報上面提到的

21
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:37,942
其實就是還是蠻基本的

22
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:38,763
你要有畫面

23
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:39,044
你要有

24
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:43,645
可以讓你判斷氣氛的一些資料

25
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,766
然後很具體的

26
00:01:44,766 --> 00:01:47,848
然後你的遊戲重點、主軸是什麼

27
00:01:47,848 --> 00:01:50,170
你的體驗大概會長怎樣

28
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,351
你的情緒、情感大概會長怎樣

29
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:54,073
你的團隊構成是什麼

30
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,054
這些都是蠻基礎的要素

31
00:01:56,526 --> 00:02:06,251
And it's fairly standard, like all the other publishers, all the reference material that add link, it will basically follow a very similar structure, right?

32
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:14,875
So, okay, this is a thing, that's what publishers want, that's what we do when we pitch to publishers, but like, why?

33
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:19,697
I mean seriously, like, why?

34
00:02:19,697 --> 00:02:25,360
對,那就是所有發行商會提出的他們的範本大概都會要你寫這些東西

35
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:28,052
那但是在你回答這些問題之前

36
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:30,533
有一個滿 應該是有一個更根本的問題是說

37
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,594
那你到底為什麼要做這件事情

38
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:36,495
There must be a good reason, so any ideas?

39
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:40,837
就是你到底為什麼 你到底為什麼要去做這個提案

40
00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:42,938
你為什麼要去做這件事情

41
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:46,679
那看大家有沒有什麼想法

42
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:49,620
為何你覺得需要提案

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:49,640
對 要賺錢

44
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,541
Who makes money?

45
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:52,982
Who makes money?

46
00:02:56,428 --> 00:03:10,420
How does this structure help the publisher make money?

47
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:19,127
I couldn't hear that, sorry.

48
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:20,328
Sorry, still cannot hear. Can you hear?

49
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:29,108
So basically, the audience said, basically, he

50
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,168
thinks that you want to have this pitch so

51
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:33,869
that the publisher can understand,

52
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:36,129
like, OK, this is a unique product.

53
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:42,051
And this unique product is out there.

54
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:43,191
If this product is out there.

55
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:48,317
it can be competitive in the market and hopefully this makes money, uh,

56
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:49,597
for the publisher and for you.

57
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:53,499
Okay. Okay. So yeah, we're getting closer. So right.

58
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:57,481
There's something about the product that you're,

59
00:03:57,481 --> 00:04:00,222
that you want to explain and,

60
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:02,723
and the publisher needs to know something about the, uh,

61
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:09,006
the product because they are going to do an analysis and a prediction,

62
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:12,308
right? That, that's what it all comes down to. Um,

63
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:17,762
So when the publisher sees your features, your pitch,

64
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:18,502
your proposal,

65
00:04:18,502 --> 00:04:23,226
the most important thing is that they need to do some analysis

66
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:25,447
that the publisher will see.

67
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:27,909
Why do they think this thing is valuable?

68
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:28,890
Or why do they do this?

69
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,812
Why do they want to sign you for this game?

70
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:37,056
So especially when you ask for money upfront,

71
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:39,938
the publisher will want to know

72
00:04:40,893 --> 00:04:42,874
whether they can make back that money.

73
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:49,718
And so they have to evaluate the product or the idea,

74
00:04:49,718 --> 00:04:51,600
depending on how far along you are.

75
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,802
And so there's this quote from Ryan Clark, who

76
00:04:54,802 --> 00:04:58,944
is the CEO, I think, of Brace Yourself Games.

77
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:03,707
They have made Crypt of the NecroDancer, Industries

78
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:06,149
of Titan.

79
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:09,991
They've been here at TGES 2018.

80
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:11,913
你下次來這裡應該跟他聊聊

81
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:17,676
他有一個類似的Podcast

82
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:18,677
他會討論如何分析遊戲

83
00:05:18,677 --> 00:05:22,039
並預測他們會做得怎麼樣

84
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:27,381
這個開發者是Ryan Clark

85
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:29,362
他是一個蠻有名的獨立遊戲團隊的負責人

86
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:33,344
就是Brace Yourself Games的負責人

87
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:36,226
他有一個Podcast叫Clark Tank

88
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,750
Clock Tank

89
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,072
在Twitch上面可以看他直播

90
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,053
那他直播完的Clock Tank的集數

91
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:43,854
也會放到YouTube上面

92
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:47,656
那他就是會根據一些

93
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:50,658
就是遊戲的特性或是一些市場的重點

94
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:52,579
去做作品分析

95
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:56,021
然後看這個東西的市場性的分析之類的

96
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,122
他們這個團隊之前做過滿多有名的遊戲

97
00:05:58,122 --> 00:05:59,423
像Crypt of Necrodancer

98
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:03,785
然後像最近有一個這個泰坦工業

99
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:05,627
這些都是還滿有名的例子

100
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:10,150
Right, and so he is basically trying

101
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,651
to solve the same problem a publisher is trying to solve,

102
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:15,773
which is to evaluate which idea to invest in.

103
00:06:15,773 --> 00:06:18,075
A publisher invests money.

104
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:21,877
You invest time, maybe even your own money.

105
00:06:21,877 --> 00:06:24,538
But it always comes down to the same thing.

106
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:30,862
Should I invest in this idea, or would another idea

107
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:33,323
be more useful to invest in?

108
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,429
發行商跟開發者在看這些東西的時候

109
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:40,490
其實雖然他的目的有點不一樣

110
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,951
可是到最後他都還是要經過

111
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:44,773
就是分析類似的事情

112
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:45,373
然後來決定

113
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:47,474
比如說發行商會是去決定說

114
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,635
他們要不要投資這款遊戲

115
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:51,736
那開發者可能是要去想說

116
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:53,878
那他經過這些分析之後

117
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:55,418
開發者自己要不要去

118
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:55,719
去開發這款遊戲

119
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:59,120
他到底要不要投資時間跟人力金錢

120
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,921
跟這個精神去做這個東西

121
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:05,681
And so all this stuff that we do, the standard structure

122
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:13,146
is basically a way to, in a structured way, take the idea apart

123
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:19,751
so that you can analyze each individual piece

124
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:24,134
and do what is called a viability analysis

125
00:07:24,134 --> 00:07:28,317
剛剛我們提到這些很常見的簡報的框架

126
00:07:28,317 --> 00:07:29,958
就是你的提案簡報的框架

127
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,660
它目的就是為了要有助於

128
00:07:32,426 --> 00:07:34,266
接到這個簡報的人

129
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:35,287
去做可行性分析

130
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:04,512
an idea about the market, but probably because you're a game developer,

131
00:08:04,512 --> 00:08:07,555
you don't really care about that too much.

132
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,836
This is mostly where the publisher comes in.

133
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:11,158
They look at tons of games.

134
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,981
They look at how games are doing in the market,

135
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:21,606
and they probably have a better feel for whether what you are making

136
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:28,792
is commercially has potential.

137
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:33,813
基本上就是你如果把那個簡報

138
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:37,735
你的體驗簡報大概區分下來的話大概就是會有這三大方面

139
00:08:37,735 --> 00:08:41,036
一個是你的遊戲的題材到底有沒有什麼

140
00:08:41,036 --> 00:08:43,077
點子或是可以吸引人的部分

141
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:44,097
那是在Hook的部分

142
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:47,799
然後你會講一下你自己的團隊的狀況跟你團隊的需求

143
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,900
那是在你的團隊的

144
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,820
討論這一塊

145
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,581
那另外一塊是

146
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:56,663
可能開發者你自己在開發遊戲的時候比較不太熟悉的可能就是市場面向

147
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:58,263
你做這款遊戲的時候你可能不太確定

148
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:01,624
到底這款遊戲在市場上的表現會是如何

149
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,926
或者是你說瞄準的目標市場到底是不是正確的

150
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:07,927
那發行商可能他有比較多

151
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:09,668
看這些遊戲跟看這些數據的經驗

152
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:11,890
他會比較熟悉市場這一塊

153
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,631
但總之它合起來就是像一個這樣子的

154
00:09:14,631 --> 00:09:16,292
可行性分析的一個概念

155
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:18,234
所以預測遊戲會成功或不成功

156
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:18,754
是非常困難的

157
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:30,008
Even the best predictors in the world,

158
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:32,930
the big publishers that are very successful,

159
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,371
even they don't predict correctly all of the time.

160
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:41,693
But that doesn't mean that there's nothing to learn here.

161
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:45,995
And all of these things that the more successful people

162
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:48,075
in the business are doing, it's not magic.

163
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:50,916
You just sit down, you learn it,

164
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,617
you practice it a little bit.

165
00:09:53,815 --> 00:10:00,221
I wanna take it apart a little bit and show you what

166
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:02,663
I'll give you an idea how to do it

167
00:10:02,663 --> 00:10:08,449
那你在預測市場或是你在看你這個東西到底可不可行的時候

168
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:10,671
這個預測或是這個判斷的準確訊息當然是

169
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:12,873
你要判斷的好是非常非常困難的

170
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:15,715
那但是總之簡單的說就是

171
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,656
這東西是可以訓練的

172
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:20,439
然後這個是有很多資訊跟很多資料你可以去參考的

173
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:25,084
So I will briefly introduce the content of the training

174
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:26,765
for your reference later.

175
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:30,747
Yeah, so let's start with the easy part

176
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:36,169
because the thing that the publisher is doing usually

177
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:41,591
is the easiest of all of them, the market analysis.

178
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:44,492
So the main question.

179
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:46,785
你應該問的是

180
00:10:46,785 --> 00:10:50,806
當你有一個遊戲的想法

181
00:10:50,806 --> 00:10:54,588
或是你想做什麼

182
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:55,188
或是你有...

183
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,169
為什麼沒有人做過這個遊戲

184
00:10:58,169 --> 00:10:59,529
然後真的問這個問題

185
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:02,670
真的研究一下這個問題

186
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,631
那其實發行商大部分在做評估的時候

187
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,272
他們通常最簡單

188
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:08,132
會最先做的也是

189
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:10,533
就是他們會最先做也是最簡單的評估這一塊

190
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:13,334
就是評估市場的這一塊

191
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:15,055
因為這方面其實說到底的話

192
00:11:17,358 --> 00:11:19,059
並不是真的那麼難做

193
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:23,343
那但是大家看到這個問題的時候

194
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:24,804
最重要的一個

195
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:26,265
你必須要問自己的問題就是

196
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:27,226
為什麼還沒有人做出這款遊戲

197
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:53,365
And another answer is, well, you can make it and you can succeed it, but there's no money.

198
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:54,925
Nobody is going to buy it.

199
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:57,366
So you don't want those two.

200
00:11:57,366 --> 00:12:00,327
那就是第一個問題這個

201
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:03,508
為什麼沒有人做過這款遊戲的答案可能有很多不同的可能性

202
00:12:03,508 --> 00:12:06,129
但是最基本的三個常見的

203
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:08,489
也許你第一個你真的有獲得

204
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:11,710
就是你真的想到一個就是萬中無一的點子沒有人做過

205
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,471
然後你如果做出來的話

206
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:15,372
那應該是會非常有效果

207
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,313
但是也有很可能是這東西根本就是很多人試過但是都失敗了

208
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:24,196
或者也有可能是很多人做了之後才知道原來這東西根本沒有市場

209
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:34,164
And I guess there's a fourth possible answer, which is, yeah, someone else has made that game, and you probably shouldn't make it then because it already exists

210
00:12:34,164 --> 00:12:38,447
對,那在後面這兩個情況,就是剛剛講到這三種情況裡面的後面兩者的話,就是

211
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:42,763
他的答案反而會變成是說

212
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,383
對,其實這個遊戲是有人做過的

213
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:45,544
只是他們都失敗了

214
00:12:45,544 --> 00:12:46,384
那也許你不應該做

215
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:49,105
所以找出答案的唯一方式

216
00:12:49,105 --> 00:12:49,445
就是坐下來

217
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:51,426
在Steam跟Edge找到

218
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:51,526
類似的遊戲

219
00:12:51,526 --> 00:12:51,986
類似你所想做的東西

220
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:52,226
類似的一個類別

221
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,571
or similar gameplay, similar mechanics,

222
00:13:03,571 --> 00:13:05,311
similar emotions you're going for if you

223
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:09,292
want to convey a certain feeling, similar style, look,

224
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:11,232
feel, music, something like that.

225
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:15,833
They find games that are similar enough to the game

226
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:16,693
that you are making.

227
00:13:16,693 --> 00:13:20,694
And I can guarantee you that you will find at least 10.

228
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:24,034
And if you do it right, you'll probably

229
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:27,675
find at least two that are very, very close to what you think

230
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:30,795
was a great original idea that nobody has ever had before.

231
00:13:32,085 --> 00:13:36,669
基本上要做這個分析很簡單的方法就是

232
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:41,514
你就是去Steam或是一曲上面找

233
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:43,256
如果你真的非常的認真找了

234
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:46,659
譬如說類型、玩法、體驗情緒

235
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:51,944
或是在外觀、審美上面都很接近的遊戲

236
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:55,387
你可以拿這些遊戲來跟你現在的想法去做比較

237
00:13:57,991 --> 00:13:59,672
幾乎可以保證你絕對可以找到

238
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,454
十款以上很接近的遊戲

239
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:04,035
然後甚至會有兩三款

240
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:07,878
可能就完全跟你要想的點子是一模一樣的

241
00:14:07,878 --> 00:14:09,699
或是問問Johnson

242
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:15,944
因為Johnson看過很多遊戲呃...

243
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:16,284
不對

244
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:17,585
不,但說真的

245
00:14:17,585 --> 00:14:18,826
我們這裡有一個社群

246
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:20,007
你可以...

247
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:20,707
我不會偷你的遊戲想法

248
00:14:20,707 --> 00:14:20,787
就問問

249
00:14:20,787 --> 00:14:21,108
當你有個想法

250
00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:28,573
也許有人知道一個你從來沒聽過的遊戲

251
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:30,274
因為它是超級競爭性的

252
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:32,755
而且你做的東西很相似

253
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:36,597
我每次都會跟我的遊戲開發者朋友聊天

254
00:14:36,597 --> 00:14:38,118
基本上就是讓

255
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:41,400
就是大家既然有這個社群在這邊

256
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,742
其實互相討論是蠻基本的行為啦

257
00:14:44,742 --> 00:14:46,983
就是大家應該平常自己都有在做類似的事情

258
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:48,344
那就只是說

259
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:50,305
你想到一個點子的時候

260
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:53,967
務必跟你認識的朋友同行

261
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:54,487
就是稍微

262
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:56,986
就是討論討教一下

263
00:14:56,986 --> 00:14:59,546
其實你可能會發現說

264
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:00,947
你沒有注意到這個東西的原因

265
00:15:00,947 --> 00:15:02,927
只是因為它確實是很匿取

266
00:15:02,927 --> 00:15:03,988
然後那個匿取可能是

267
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:05,188
你剛好之前都沒有調查過

268
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:05,968
你沒有看過的

269
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:08,069
你不知道有那一塊

270
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:09,849
所以你以為那個是你原創的東西

271
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:12,270
但是通常你如果多問幾個人

272
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,950
別人可能都會給你一些回答

273
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:18,330
And so when you have those at least 10 similar games,

274
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,932
you look at how they did.

275
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:22,134
You can easily see their price.

276
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:26,098
You can easily see how many user reviews they have.

277
00:15:26,098 --> 00:15:29,542
And from the user reviews, you get a good idea.

278
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,311
how much they sold.

279
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:34,553
There are like Steam analysis websites.

280
00:15:34,553 --> 00:15:35,834
Johnson knows all about that.

281
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,256
You can see their Steam page, how they market the game.

282
00:15:39,256 --> 00:15:41,918
You can see what they highlight.

283
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:44,760
You can read the user reviews, what the users think

284
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,102
is great, what the users think the game is lacking.

285
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:49,143
Maybe the thing that

286
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:52,953
If you have a game that is similar with a negative review

287
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,815
that says, OK, this game would be great if it only had this,

288
00:15:55,815 --> 00:15:59,117
and that happens to be exactly your game,

289
00:15:59,117 --> 00:16:07,983
that's already a way to then fine tune your marketing

290
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:11,585
to say, it's this game, but it solves this one

291
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:13,266
problem of the game.

292
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:15,667
But really look at it.

293
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:19,877
如果他們做得不好 或是做得不好

294
00:16:19,877 --> 00:16:22,898
記得要包括一些做得不好的

295
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:26,799
不要只看黑心靈

296
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,800
對 那就是在比較這些基礎的

297
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,661
很容易看到的公開資訊的時候

298
00:16:31,661 --> 00:16:34,082
很重要的就是你要

299
00:16:34,082 --> 00:16:36,403
不是只有比較好的

300
00:16:36,403 --> 00:16:39,504
你要不好的 你要一起放進去比較

301
00:16:39,504 --> 00:16:40,645
然後為什麼他們做得不好

302
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:44,331
甚至有時候你看到一款作品

303
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:45,592
可能跟你想的確實很像

304
00:16:45,592 --> 00:16:48,714
但是它也許是一個負評比較多的遊戲

305
00:16:48,714 --> 00:16:51,316
那這個時候甚至你就已經可以開始去

306
00:16:51,316 --> 00:16:54,139
設想你的行銷或是推廣的策略

307
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,840
就是你是這款遊戲

308
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,681
但是你把這些東西解決了

309
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:59,363
所以你是一個

310
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:01,084
還是算一個有特定獨特性的作品

311
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:03,166
然後是市場上之前沒有的

312
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,047
或是沒有做到好的

313
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:06,508
所以就以一個例子來說

314
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:08,430
在傑克的傑克Move的案例

315
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:21,007
你會看JRPG、Pixel Art、Cyberpunk的遊戲

316
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,208
然後看他們各自的做法

317
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,189
然後你會專注在團隊尺寸上

318
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:33,112
而不是Final Fantasy的團隊尺寸

319
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:34,593
那在比較的時候

320
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:37,194
像以剛剛Jack Move這個

321
00:17:38,168 --> 00:17:40,490
之前提到這款作品為例的話

322
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,652
那你會看到的類型可能就是你會去鎖定

323
00:17:43,652 --> 00:17:46,834
他是Cyberpunk他是2D他是Pixel Art

324
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,176
他是日式RPG之類的

325
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:55,341
那你在比較這東西的時候一定會有像剛剛其實剛剛就有講到了嘛就是有大有小遊戲有大小團隊

326
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:59,004
那你要看的是比較接近自己量級的而不是看

327
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:00,745
故意去看那些其實跟自己量級差很遠的

328
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:06,077
所以像我剛才說的,這是簡單的部分

329
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:12,682
這可能不是你最有興趣的事情

330
00:18:12,682 --> 00:18:15,345
但是如果你做這個

331
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,146
它會讓你處理得更好

332
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:20,368
在內部上,如果你在跟一個公司商討

333
00:18:20,368 --> 00:18:23,551
因為你已經展示你做了研究

334
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:25,392
總之這方面其實

335
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:26,673
剛剛講到就是不難

336
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,135
但是說你一定要

337
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:29,616
不管是在自己要做遊戲之前

338
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:31,217
還是你要跟發行商提案之前

339
00:18:31,217 --> 00:18:32,218
你都一定會需要做這些事

340
00:18:33,202 --> 00:18:37,963
All right.

341
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:45,444
And then, again, once you have those 10 similar games,

342
00:18:45,444 --> 00:18:47,165
what you can understand from those

343
00:18:47,165 --> 00:18:52,546
is you can make a prediction about how well your game is

344
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:56,567
potentially going to do.

345
00:18:56,567 --> 00:19:00,808
You see an upper limit on how many people are even

346
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:03,088
going to buy it if things go right.

347
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:06,273
because not everyone buys, I don't know, JRPGs, right?

348
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:14,467
You can have a rough idea about what the expected sales,

349
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:16,308
like how many copies you're going to sell,

350
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:18,329
and add a number, 100,000, right?

351
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:21,150
Like 100,000 is a very good number

352
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,132
because it's not like crazy.

353
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:27,473
It's not 1 million, 3 million, 10 million.

354
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:30,215
But it's also not like 10K, right?

355
00:19:30,215 --> 00:19:33,856
It's like, that's a juicy number if you sell 100,000 copies

356
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:33,956
at $15.

357
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:35,397
That's 1.5 million, right?

358
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:41,033
So that's about the money we are talking

359
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:43,795
like the total amount of money we are talking

360
00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:45,616
and that affects everything

361
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:49,598
and the other thing I already

362
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:52,600
well ok translate that first maybe

363
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,442
對所以就是像

364
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:56,762
我們在前面看到Jack Move

365
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,964
他自己的市場預估

366
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,566
其實也有看到就是一個10萬套這樣的數字

367
00:20:02,566 --> 00:20:04,107
那就是假設說

368
00:20:04,107 --> 00:20:05,848
他已經做過這麼多前面的分析

369
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:09,829
那他在可能在比較理想的情況下

370
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:11,491
他會希望可以達到那個數字

371
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:13,993
那就代表是接近是你的

372
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:15,935
比如說一個作品銷售的一個

373
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:18,637
你可以去預估的天花板

374
00:20:18,637 --> 00:20:20,499
或者是說是一個

375
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:21,860
你想要去達到的目標

376
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,263
那是你的期望值

377
00:20:25,263 --> 00:20:27,385
那你有這個期望值之後

378
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:30,667
你算出你大概可以獲得多少的毛利

379
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:31,969
多少的營收

380
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:33,250
那你後續的所有策略

381
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,391
基本上就要從裡面推回來

382
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:36,272
就你已經有這個預估

383
00:20:36,272 --> 00:20:37,953
所以你後續要做的事情

384
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:39,715
大概就是以這個預估為前提

385
00:20:39,715 --> 00:20:42,717
比如說你的理想營收是

386
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:44,819
假設是一百萬美金

387
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:47,421
那你一百萬美金的營收的前提之下

388
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:50,243
你可以做什麼事情對

389
00:20:50,243 --> 00:20:57,789
那另一個讓你去分析其他遊戲的方法

390
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:58,890
就是看他們如何推廣自己的遊戲

391
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,911
然後你再看那些做得好

392
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:09,678
and yet the ones that didn't do well, is there a difference in the way they talk to potential customers?

393
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:15,439
What does their Steam page look like? Do they have lots of screenshots?

394
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:19,960
Do they say certain other keywords that people like to hear?

395
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,502
In the negative reviews, what's the common thing that people complain about?

396
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:31,243
That's how you can already structure your promotion.

397
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:32,823
You don't have promotion material yet.

398
00:21:33,195 --> 00:21:36,218
但你已經知道該說什麼了

399
00:21:36,218 --> 00:21:41,201
你想要推廣遊戲的時候 說哪些詞語是重要的

400
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:44,543
哪些詞語是沒有意義的

401
00:21:44,543 --> 00:21:47,966
那看完之前那些資料分析

402
00:21:47,966 --> 00:21:49,927
你如果有做過這些分析的話

403
00:21:49,927 --> 00:21:53,590
就算你還手上沒有一個實際可以拿來做

404
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,271
就是行銷推廣的產品

405
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:57,232
你的行銷計畫也還沒有做完

406
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,393
但是你看過這些分析之後

407
00:21:58,393 --> 00:21:59,934
你就已經可以開始出現

408
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:00,735
你就可以開始去規劃說

409
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:05,508
那我到底要用哪一些關鍵字來推銷這款遊戲

410
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:07,529
然後你可以推銷給誰

411
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:09,009
你的這個

412
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,850
你看其他類似遊戲的負評

413
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,010
他們在抱怨是什麼

414
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,451
你能不能解決這些問題

415
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:15,752
這個都可以直接納入到你自己的

416
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,572
未來的這個推廣跟行銷的計畫裡面

417
00:22:17,572 --> 00:22:20,313
And you can already tell

418
00:22:20,313 --> 00:22:22,414
how competitive is the market

419
00:22:22,414 --> 00:22:24,034
that you are going to get into

420
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:25,635
like are there

421
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,235
is it currently a very hot market

422
00:22:27,235 --> 00:22:29,056
because everyone is making survival games

423
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,476
and you are making a survival game

424
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:30,917
or is it

425
00:22:31,365 --> 00:22:34,287
Is it a dead market because you're making, I don't know,

426
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:36,288
a point and click adventure, and we

427
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:41,592
haven't had a very successful one since the 90s?

428
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:51,819
Like, get an understanding of how competitive it will be,

429
00:22:51,819 --> 00:22:54,240
how difficult it would be to stand out

430
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,863
from the other games that are similar to you.

431
00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:01,197
然後你做完分析的同時

432
00:23:01,197 --> 00:23:03,399
你也會知道到底在這個市場裡面

433
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:05,420
你的目標市場到底競爭激不激烈

434
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,721
你是去挑了一個生存遊戲

435
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:09,642
生存類型的遊戲

436
00:23:09,642 --> 00:23:11,243
所以現在大家都在做生存類型遊戲

437
00:23:11,243 --> 00:23:12,824
那這個就很競爭

438
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,304
還是你挑的是一個

439
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:15,805
相對來講已經冷門

440
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:18,047
甚至快死掉的類別

441
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:22,529
那也許譬如說是像很傳統的

442
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:24,870
就是Point&Click點擊式的

443
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,771
這種美式的冒險遊戲

444
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:25,791
那

445
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:30,934
你做的這些東西就是

446
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:32,535
他會直接決定到

447
00:23:32,535 --> 00:23:34,456
你日後會遇到多少的就是競爭

448
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:37,898
Yeah, and then finally the business model

449
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:40,279
you probably want a similar business model to

450
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,160
games that are similar

451
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,662
I mean for us is probably gonna be

452
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:48,204
just premium on steam

453
00:23:48,204 --> 00:23:50,725
with no like micro transactions or something

454
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:53,247
but if you are

455
00:23:54,028 --> 00:23:59,570
看Free-to-Play或其他類似的遊戲

456
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,290
你會想知道

457
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,171
什麼類似的遊戲

458
00:24:02,171 --> 00:24:03,512
如何解決這些問題

459
00:24:03,512 --> 00:24:08,274
商業模式也影響了遊戲的一切

460
00:24:08,274 --> 00:24:09,694
商業模式的部分

461
00:24:09,694 --> 00:24:11,815
雖然說對在場的大部分的開發者

462
00:24:11,815 --> 00:24:15,016
或是對現在大家比較容易切入的市場

463
00:24:15,016 --> 00:24:18,778
可能都是你要看Steam的Premium Game這樣

464
00:24:18,778 --> 00:24:22,099
但是就算你今天是做Free-to-Play在手機上

465
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:23,420
你大概也會需要遇到

466
00:24:24,302 --> 00:24:29,023
就是需要分析這些東西,然後你要決定說這些東西

467
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:32,624
這個不同類型的商業模式,它賺錢的方式,它的遊戲類型

468
00:24:32,624 --> 00:24:35,825
其實都會直接有影響,就是不太可能就是說把這東西切開

469
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:41,586
Do we have anyone making free to play games in this community?

470
00:24:41,586 --> 00:24:47,728
We have before, like more of them are making free to play and mobile games before

471
00:24:47,728 --> 00:24:49,308
But like more and more

472
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,222
至少在台灣,Indie 開發者在過去的三、四、五年都回到電腦上

473
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:55,162
對,手機是非常競爭性和困難的

474
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:55,963
好,我們繼續,我們繼續到第二波

475
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:57,063
為什麼你會有一個在你的Pitch Deck中的部分

476
00:24:57,063 --> 00:25:00,024
可以解釋你是誰,還有你跟你的人是怎麼回事

477
00:25:00,024 --> 00:25:00,285
為什麼我們是

478
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:01,745
就是在提案簡報裡面,你為什麼要放一個你的團隊說明在裡面

479
00:25:19,197 --> 00:25:21,379
Like, why is that interesting to the publisher?

480
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:23,361
I shouldn't have revealed the slide.

481
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:25,362
Yeah, it's already revealed.

482
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:26,423
It's already there.

483
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:35,831
So the chances are the publisher has heard your pitch already

484
00:25:35,831 --> 00:25:36,672
from someone else.

485
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:44,857
Basically a very very similar pitch because people come up with the same stuff all the time. It's ridiculous. So the

486
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:49,500
the thing that makes you stand out is

487
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,202
the people you have

488
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:56,624
So

489
00:25:56,624 --> 00:26:00,666
One of the problems the publisher is trying to

490
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:02,027
to evaluate is

491
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:05,388
Will you actually be able to pull this off?

492
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:11,392
Can you make this game? Do you have what it takes to make this game?

493
00:26:11,392 --> 00:26:14,933
Do you have the expertise, the skill?

494
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:18,834
Are you excited about the idea?

495
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:20,595
These kind of questions

496
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:24,516
那 方琦桑他在看到你的提案簡報的時候

497
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:30,978
其實可能他已經看過非常多類似

498
00:26:30,978 --> 00:26:33,098
類型或是類似內容的遊戲

499
00:26:33,098 --> 00:26:34,939
已經就是都 之前都提案過了

500
00:26:34,939 --> 00:26:34,959
那

501
00:26:36,005 --> 00:26:38,986
他們其實不會覺得

502
00:26:38,986 --> 00:26:40,226
就是不見得會覺得說

503
00:26:40,226 --> 00:26:43,007
你的提案跟之前的人有差異

504
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:44,828
就是非常多在哪邊

505
00:26:44,828 --> 00:26:49,409
那能夠這時候能夠分出高下的地方

506
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:50,529
可能會是在於說

507
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:52,310
發行商會覺得你的團隊

508
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,011
看起來確實更適合做這款遊戲

509
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:57,432
不管是你的描述可能更生動

510
00:26:57,432 --> 00:26:59,072
你的你表現出來的態度可能

511
00:26:59,832 --> 00:27:03,394
就是更積極,然後你對這個類型可能更了解

512
00:27:03,394 --> 00:27:05,635
或者是說,你的相關的專長

513
00:27:05,635 --> 00:27:09,237
你的這個過去的個人經歷還是團隊經歷

514
00:27:09,237 --> 00:27:10,778
可以佐證這個事情

515
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:13,359
那這些東西其實都會影響到發行商

516
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,080
或者是其他看到你提案的人

517
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,280
對你的這個事情的評價

518
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,622
And then the thing that happens all the time

519
00:27:18,622 --> 00:27:21,443
is like people want to make

520
00:27:21,443 --> 00:27:22,904
an MMO, World of Warcraft

521
00:27:22,904 --> 00:27:24,885
or Command Conquer

522
00:27:24,885 --> 00:27:25,825
or Dark Souls

523
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:28,747
or like, there's a AAA game coming out

524
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:30,693
Everyone loves it.

525
00:27:30,693 --> 00:27:36,054
Everyone wants to make a game like that.

526
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,175
And you have three people.

527
00:27:37,175 --> 00:27:43,556
And you make a shadow of the Colossus clone.

528
00:27:43,556 --> 00:27:46,757
And that is crazy.

529
00:27:46,757 --> 00:27:52,858
Does the scope of your project fit the size of your team?

530
00:27:52,858 --> 00:27:56,919
That's a very important question you should answer.

531
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,331
up front

532
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:06,356
Because if your team is very small, you have to have like crazy good people to pull that off

533
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:07,697
對那

534
00:28:07,697 --> 00:28:09,479
就是你的

535
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:14,982
你在發想遊戲點子或者是你在看到哪些遊戲會影響你未來想要做的事情的目標的時候

536
00:28:14,982 --> 00:28:21,067
可能會說我看到這些很棒的3A遊戲我最近玩得很爽那我才想要做這些東西

537
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:22,508
那但是

538
00:28:22,508 --> 00:28:23,248
可能

539
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:25,630
沒有經驗的人會覺得說就是

540
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:25,930
欸這些東西

541
00:28:26,944 --> 00:28:28,284
感覺好像也沒有很難做

542
00:28:28,284 --> 00:28:30,305
那我也可以來做做看

543
00:28:30,305 --> 00:28:31,605
那但是你去忽略

544
00:28:31,605 --> 00:28:33,546
去忽略說人家可能是百人團隊做

545
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,426
然後你可能是三個人

546
00:28:35,426 --> 00:28:39,107
對 那

547
00:28:39,107 --> 00:28:40,407
剛剛在笑的原因我不知道要不要解釋

548
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:47,009
沒有 因為剛才有個舉例是就是

549
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:48,649
就是

550
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:50,330
就是你可能看到汪達與巨像

551
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,830
汪達與巨像是你這個

552
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,850
就是以3A作品來講是一個非常有藝術性

553
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,131
然後也很創新的遊戲 你就

554
00:28:56,104 --> 00:28:58,666
有一個很重要的

555
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:01,188
在你的內心留下一個很大的衝擊

556
00:29:01,188 --> 00:29:02,329
對 那但是呢

557
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:03,470
你可能就是覺得

558
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,271
我也要做一個

559
00:29:04,271 --> 00:29:06,173
汪達與巨像的類似遊戲

560
00:29:06,173 --> 00:29:07,614
但你只有三個人

561
00:29:07,614 --> 00:29:09,756
但是我們現場就有一位

562
00:29:09,756 --> 00:29:10,817
這個三個人做汪達與巨像

563
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:11,177
團隊在現場

564
00:29:11,177 --> 00:29:11,978
對 而且他們其實賣得還不錯

565
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:23,902
Anyway, so the size of your team gives you the burndown rate,

566
00:29:23,902 --> 00:29:25,564
the monthly expenses, right?

567
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:27,286
And then the scope of your project

568
00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:30,209
gives you the amount, the number of month that you.

569
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:32,350
I expect to work on this.

570
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,232
So that gives you the total budget.

571
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:36,673
That's what it costs to make the game.

572
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:40,956
And then on this slide, the expected sales

573
00:29:40,956 --> 00:29:42,537
were the total revenue.

574
00:29:42,537 --> 00:29:47,320
And then you subtract 30% for Steam and another 20% for taxes.

575
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,542
So let's say half of the revenue goes away

576
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:53,604
and the other half is what you keep.

577
00:29:53,604 --> 00:29:55,926
And then you compare those two numbers.

578
00:29:55,926 --> 00:29:59,808
And then it should come out that.

579
00:30:00,688 --> 00:30:03,610
not only is the expected sales,

580
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,273
like not only will you make money,

581
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:09,135
but you should also make a lot of extra money

582
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:11,778
because your scope is probably gonna be wrong,

583
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:15,781
you're gonna take longer, you're gonna need more team,

584
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:17,863
maybe hire someone or more time.

585
00:30:17,863 --> 00:30:21,946
So you wanna have extra runway,

586
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:24,829
extra money if things go wrong.

587
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,460
等下你從你的遊戲規模

588
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,661
從你的團隊的大小

589
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,101
你就可以去算出你的預算

590
00:30:32,101 --> 00:30:32,781
或是你去估計

591
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:35,122
可以至少會對預算做一個估計

592
00:30:35,122 --> 00:30:37,922
那我們在前面也有講到

593
00:30:37,922 --> 00:30:40,143
你看了這些市場分析

594
00:30:40,143 --> 00:30:41,583
跟你的遊戲點值的分析之後

595
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:45,064
你大概看出了這個上限值是多少

596
00:30:45,064 --> 00:30:47,984
那基本上這就可以直接去推估出

597
00:30:47,984 --> 00:30:49,765
譬如說那你要做這款遊戲

598
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,105
或是做這個類型遊戲

599
00:30:51,105 --> 00:30:52,445
你應該要花多久時間做

600
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:54,006
你要花多少錢做

601
00:30:54,006 --> 00:30:54,546
你能撐多久

602
00:30:55,715 --> 00:30:57,497
這個大概就是一個很關鍵的

603
00:30:57,497 --> 00:30:59,378
你必須要在分析完這兩部分

604
00:30:59,378 --> 00:31:01,700
分析完那個遊戲點子

605
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,522
跟分析完你的團隊之後

606
00:31:03,522 --> 00:31:04,463
你要能夠做的決定

607
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:07,145
And so to give an example

608
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:09,127
I think for Ed

609
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:11,369
so the expected sales are

610
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,313
I don't know like 1.5 million, 2 million, right?

611
00:31:15,313 --> 00:31:21,298
And the budget I think was about

612
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:21,739
10% of that?

613
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:33,901
So, right, let's say 2 million, budget is 200k, so you have a factor 10 in there, right?

614
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:43,927
That's how big the ideal profit margin would be.

615
00:31:43,927 --> 00:31:46,068
Right.

616
00:31:46,068 --> 00:31:47,288
Yeah, so of course...

617
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:51,876
If I say 2 million, that really means 1 million, right?

618
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:55,296
Because Steam takes a cut, and taxes take a cut.

619
00:31:55,296 --> 00:31:58,697
And then so of this 1 million, the publisher

620
00:31:58,697 --> 00:32:03,858
has to do the marketing, and they take a cut.

621
00:32:03,858 --> 00:32:04,958
So we're down to a factor of 5.

622
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:07,759
Maybe we're down to a factor of 4 now.

623
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,600
But you can see how this shrinks.

624
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,220
And that's the runway that's shrinking if things go wrong.

625
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:21,883
If your calculation comes out at, I don't know, 1.5,

626
00:32:21,883 --> 00:32:26,347
factor 1.5, that's already a failure, right?

627
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:28,528
You definitely want to have, I don't know,

628
00:32:28,528 --> 00:32:34,894
like factor 4 or 5 at least in there for risk management.

629
00:32:36,305 --> 00:32:38,205
對 那就是剛剛又舉到了

630
00:32:38,205 --> 00:32:39,265
就是JMOV的例子

631
00:32:39,265 --> 00:32:43,066
那他可能自己預估的

632
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:44,747
就是或是其實目前大概就是

633
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:45,947
已經知道的預算抓出來

634
00:32:45,947 --> 00:32:47,227
就是他實際上需要的錢

635
00:32:47,227 --> 00:32:50,028
也許是譬如說20萬美金

636
00:32:50,028 --> 00:32:51,788
那剛剛看到他可以賣

637
00:32:51,788 --> 00:32:53,329
假設可以希望的目標

638
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:54,969
期望值是可以賣到10萬套

639
00:32:54,969 --> 00:32:56,729
那也許那樣子有

640
00:32:56,729 --> 00:32:57,930
譬如說100萬 200萬美金的收入

641
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,790
那你這個成數可能是5倍10倍之類的

642
00:33:01,351 --> 00:33:03,312
可是你這個倍率又會因為

643
00:33:03,312 --> 00:33:04,253
譬如說各種的失誤

644
00:33:04,253 --> 00:33:05,535
然後你的估計錯誤

645
00:33:05,535 --> 00:33:07,617
你的開發時間延長

646
00:33:07,617 --> 00:33:11,460
或是發行商需要花費的其他成本

647
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,882
那個都會一直讓你的

648
00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:14,783
能夠撐多久的這件事情慢慢下降

649
00:33:14,783 --> 00:33:17,586
然後你的獲利的可能性也會慢慢下降

650
00:33:17,586 --> 00:33:20,089
所以如果你當初預估出來的一個

651
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:24,513
市場數值跟你的團隊花費的預算

652
00:33:24,513 --> 00:33:25,133
做出了比例你發現說

653
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,683
這個比例只差一倍兩倍

654
00:33:28,683 --> 00:33:30,143
那就代表其實你這東西

655
00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:31,004
就算你真的做了

656
00:33:31,004 --> 00:33:32,084
大概也不會有任何賺錢

657
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:34,845
你一開始你的點子想好之後

658
00:33:34,845 --> 00:33:36,305
它就已經是一個

659
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,606
接近註定商業失敗的產品

660
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,343
I think like a couple million, like let's say 5 million.

661
00:34:00,343 --> 00:34:03,004
So that's about factor 6.

662
00:34:03,004 --> 00:34:07,926
And take Steam and taxes as factor 3.

663
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:12,708
So it could be pretty tight.

664
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:15,749
But then it turns out that the game did much better than 1

665
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:18,871
million, and so we kept developing it.

666
00:34:18,871 --> 00:34:21,932
So at the end, I think it sold like 5 million,

667
00:34:21,932 --> 00:34:24,393
and the development cost was about $10 million.

668
00:34:25,782 --> 00:34:29,004
So you get, what is that?

669
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:29,244
5 million, 150?

670
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:29,825
5 million.

671
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:30,806
$150 million, right?

672
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:31,886
Yeah.

673
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:32,067
Yeah.

674
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:35,930
And so development costs 10 million.

675
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:41,434
So you have a factor of like seven or eight

676
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:45,417
or something in there as a profit.

677
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,200
Anyway, that's like a super success, right?

678
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,421
Like that's a lot of extra profit.

679
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:54,545
Everything went very well.

680
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:55,205
Most of the time.

681
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:56,593
如果你幸運的話,你甚至會摔倒

682
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:14,882
因為那不是他們團隊的第一款作品

683
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:16,663
他們團隊在做聖海明洋的時候

684
00:35:16,663 --> 00:35:18,084
其實已經蠻大了

685
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:20,845
那當時他們的估計

686
00:35:20,845 --> 00:35:24,847
剛講是希望可以賣到一百萬套

687
00:35:24,847 --> 00:35:27,008
然後他們的定價是大約30美金上下

688
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:27,288
所以是一個

689
00:35:28,482 --> 00:35:30,864
比較像2A的定價規模

690
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:32,345
那當時你如果這樣算的話

691
00:35:32,345 --> 00:35:34,667
你就會算出來就是是

692
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:37,170
譬如說你有呃

693
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,771
3000萬美金的營收

694
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:41,294
那他們當初自己估的團隊成本

695
00:35:41,294 --> 00:35:43,956
是大約呃

696
00:35:43,956 --> 00:35:44,677
500萬美金上下

697
00:35:44,677 --> 00:35:46,379
所以3000萬美金500萬美金

698
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:48,400
就大概是五六倍的差距

699
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,162
那所以在那個情況下

700
00:35:50,162 --> 00:35:51,964
他去他去做這個預估就覺得說

701
00:35:51,964 --> 00:35:53,185
可能他的

702
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,570
這個中間的差距

703
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,111
那個誤差值還算蠻大的

704
00:35:59,111 --> 00:36:01,452
那後來也是運氣很好的

705
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:04,073
他遊戲不只賣了一百萬套

706
00:36:04,073 --> 00:36:07,454
遊戲後來在各平台總計加起來賣了大概快五百萬套

707
00:36:07,454 --> 00:36:11,035
所以他實際上的銷售總額是已經有破億美金

708
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,676
那他因為一開始成功了之後

709
00:36:13,676 --> 00:36:15,336
他又開始加更多東西進去

710
00:36:15,336 --> 00:36:18,837
所以他整隊的執行的這個執行成本上升了

711
00:36:18,837 --> 00:36:19,858
但是並沒有上升很多

712
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:21,798
譬如說他本來是預估五百萬美金

713
00:36:21,798 --> 00:36:23,239
他後來是實際花了一千萬美金在開發

714
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:26,690
但是他們實際上收到一億美金以上

715
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,091
那這個就是運氣非常好

716
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:35,834
然後等於說是不太能夠當作標榜的一個例子

717
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:38,575
因為你不太能夠去預期你都是這樣大成功

718
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:41,656
那通常的時候你能夠打平就很不錯了

719
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,621
所以在一般的獨立規格

720
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:46,681
我們在說兩三個人的團隊

721
00:36:46,681 --> 00:36:49,402
通常會有一個或兩個零數的減少

722
00:36:49,402 --> 00:36:54,123
在所有的數字之中

723
00:36:54,123 --> 00:36:57,304
所以做你的計算

724
00:36:57,304 --> 00:36:59,165
我們一般的就是

725
00:36:59,165 --> 00:37:00,765
剛起步的微型團隊

726
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:02,706
你會算的這個數字

727
00:37:02,706 --> 00:37:04,946
大概可能少一個零或少兩個零都有可能

728
00:37:04,946 --> 00:37:05,646
如果你賣十萬張的文件

729
00:37:05,646 --> 00:37:06,647
那是一個獨立的成功

730
00:37:06,647 --> 00:37:06,887
那是關於

731
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:16,247
你能獲得的收入

732
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:20,050
那就是我們一般的衛星團隊做出來的

733
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,171
就是不是2A等級的作品

734
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:24,993
可能你能預期的銷售量也許是在10萬套上下

735
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,154
最好的情況

736
00:37:26,154 --> 00:37:28,936
那那個大概就是你的上限

737
00:37:28,936 --> 00:37:29,977
所以我們那邊有一個右邊

738
00:37:29,977 --> 00:37:32,739
左邊那邊是關於你能不能做到

739
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:33,499
然後右邊那邊是

740
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:33,819
你能不能做到

741
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:48,690
Why is your team the perfect team to make this game?

742
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,610
Why not some other team with the same?

743
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:54,511
If the idea is good and the budget and the scope is fine,

744
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:59,832
but what is special about you that aligns with the game

745
00:37:59,832 --> 00:38:01,952
that you're making?

746
00:38:01,952 --> 00:38:08,073
Maybe your company is all about JRPGs, and this is a JRPG,

747
00:38:08,073 --> 00:38:09,134
and that's why.

748
00:38:09,134 --> 00:38:11,734
Or maybe, in our case, Subnautica.

749
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:16,925
The company was about nonviolence,

750
00:38:16,925 --> 00:38:18,767
and the game was a nonviolent game.

751
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:22,830
So there's a strong value connection between the two.

752
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:25,292
And then your personal values, if you are indies,

753
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:28,675
like your company and you as a person

754
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:30,137
are kind of like the same thing.

755
00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:35,541
So see how what you are trying to create

756
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:39,845
aligns with who you are, what you believe in, what it means.

757
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:44,108
Why is it something that ties to you as a person

758
00:38:44,108 --> 00:38:45,849
or as a company?

759
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:50,211
I want to add that your boss basically

760
00:38:50,211 --> 00:38:52,112
said after natural selection, they

761
00:38:52,112 --> 00:38:54,273
don't want to make a shooting game.

762
00:38:54,273 --> 00:38:56,574
OK, so I can give a little bit of history.

763
00:38:56,574 --> 00:39:00,476
Because the game we made before Spelunica

764
00:39:00,476 --> 00:39:03,077
was a shooter, competitive shooter, right?

765
00:39:03,077 --> 00:39:05,798
But the company is in the US.

766
00:39:05,798 --> 00:39:09,160
And I think that was 2013, they had one of the big school

767
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,640
shootings.

768
00:39:10,604 --> 00:39:12,685
And the boss was really upset about that.

769
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:17,726
And he was saying, OK, we don't want to put more violence out

770
00:39:17,726 --> 00:39:18,466
into the world.

771
00:39:18,466 --> 00:39:22,747
Even though the boss believes that just playing a game

772
00:39:22,747 --> 00:39:25,848
and shooting real guns is very different

773
00:39:25,848 --> 00:39:28,668
and doesn't mean the same thing.

774
00:39:28,668 --> 00:39:32,429
But he was just so upset about this real world thing

775
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:33,890
that he was saying, OK, no.

776
00:39:35,127 --> 00:39:38,908
我們要做些不同的東西

777
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:40,608
所以這個核心的價值

778
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:42,308
就被傳播到遊戲的創作

779
00:39:42,308 --> 00:39:44,269
有著非常強烈的連結

780
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:46,310
那就是

781
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:49,810
我們看完就是我們有沒有能力做

782
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,331
這個團隊評估之後

783
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:51,411
就是團隊評估做完

784
00:39:51,411 --> 00:39:52,271
我們有沒有能力做

785
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:53,712
那我們到底為什麼要做這個東西

786
00:39:53,712 --> 00:39:55,372
為什麼是我們來做

787
00:39:55,372 --> 00:39:56,952
這個事情就是你自己的團隊

788
00:39:56,952 --> 00:40:00,533
跟你自己個人本身要去衡量的事情

789
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:02,554
那以Subnautica為例的話

790
00:40:02,554 --> 00:40:02,814
其實他們

791
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:08,853
那個公司本身之前做的遊戲是一個連線的

792
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:12,856
非對稱式的

793
00:40:12,856 --> 00:40:14,797
第一人稱射擊遊戲

794
00:40:14,797 --> 00:40:17,339
因為那段時間好像在2013年前後的時候

795
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:19,721
美國那時候那陣子連續發生好幾件

796
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:23,483
重大的校園槍擊案件

797
00:40:23,483 --> 00:40:27,586
就是公司的創辦人本身非常的生氣

798
00:40:27,586 --> 00:40:29,467
他不希望自己的遊戲

799
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:31,449
就是又

800
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:38,204
創造了更多把槍械變得很酷炫的那種情感丟到市場裡面

801
00:40:38,204 --> 00:40:43,829
他希望直接做一款完全沒有任何槍枝可以做攻擊的

802
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:45,950
或是說做殺害的這種遊戲進去

803
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:50,334
那個時候他這個公司的目標

804
00:40:50,334 --> 00:40:53,437
就跟後來他要做Subnautica的這個情感

805
00:40:53,437 --> 00:40:55,498
或者是說他的價值的連結就非常的深

806
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:00,208
我們是最大的黑暗靈魂粉絲

807
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,909
所以我們想要製作黑暗靈魂系列

808
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:04,030
這不算數

809
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,230
OK

810
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,131
對 那基本上就是

811
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,532
有一個很重要的重點是

812
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:10,113
如果你只是說我們是一個

813
00:41:10,113 --> 00:41:12,334
黑暗靈魂系列的忠實支持者

814
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:15,636
所以我要做一款黑暗靈魂系列遊戲

815
00:41:15,636 --> 00:41:21,179
這樣子的YR是不能用這種回答做答案的對

816
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:21,419
這個問題很有趣

817
00:41:21,419 --> 00:41:22,960
我不太常看到有人談論這個問題

818
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,260
但是我認為

819
00:41:27,413 --> 00:41:29,354
I learned something here when I first heard that.

820
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:38,077
So advantage is about, OK, imagine your perfect idea,

821
00:41:38,077 --> 00:41:40,038
your pitch got leaked.

822
00:41:40,038 --> 00:41:41,678
And now it's public on the internet,

823
00:41:41,678 --> 00:41:46,060
and everyone knows about this crazy good idea.

824
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:49,221
What is the advantage you still have,

825
00:41:49,221 --> 00:41:51,122
even though the secret is out?

826
00:41:51,122 --> 00:41:52,962
What's the advantage your team still

827
00:41:52,962 --> 00:41:53,863
has over?

828
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:59,399
over other teams that might try to take the idea

829
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:02,782
and beat you to market because you haven't actually

830
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:04,283
made the product yet, right?

831
00:42:04,283 --> 00:42:08,546
Like do you have like one year ahead of everyone else

832
00:42:08,546 --> 00:42:10,908
because you've already worked on this prototype

833
00:42:10,908 --> 00:42:12,870
and you've already figured out hard problems?

834
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:16,573
Do you, have you worked on a similar game

835
00:42:16,573 --> 00:42:18,554
that where you solved some hard problems

836
00:42:18,554 --> 00:42:20,356
that other people still have to solve?

837
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:21,637
Is there some like special?

838
00:42:22,395 --> 00:42:29,118
Are you the super physics programmer that is very difficult to replicate for others?

839
00:42:29,118 --> 00:42:38,583
Ideally, you have to have something that gives you the edge even if other people know exactly

840
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:39,384
what you're doing.

841
00:42:39,384 --> 00:42:44,867
What that allows you to do is also talk about it a little bit earlier and talk about it

842
00:42:44,867 --> 00:42:47,268
a little bit more openly.

843
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:51,350
When you pitch to publishers, you don't have to be so afraid that they will just like...

844
00:42:52,055 --> 00:42:59,379
Oh yeah, that's a good idea. And we have this other team here. Maybe we'll just give it to them.

845
00:42:59,379 --> 00:42:59,660
Right?

846
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:04,242
那再來就是競爭優勢這一塊,就是Jonas覺得好像平常比較少人看到特別針對這一塊講

847
00:43:04,242 --> 00:43:09,366
那最簡單的一個描述的方式就是說,假設今天你有一個超棒的點子

848
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:12,708
然後這個超棒的點子不小心流到網路上了,已經大家都知道了

849
00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:15,411
那在這種情況下

850
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:18,574
你身為一個團隊或是你這個個人開發者

851
00:43:18,574 --> 00:43:21,077
還有沒有任何剩下的優勢就是說

852
00:43:21,077 --> 00:43:24,200
當大家都跟你有一樣點子的時候你還是

853
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,882
最適合來執行這個點子的人

854
00:43:26,882 --> 00:43:29,365
那可能是你有解決過相關問題

855
00:43:29,365 --> 00:43:30,766
可能是

856
00:43:30,766 --> 00:43:32,227
你已經有一個

857
00:43:32,227 --> 00:43:34,009
相當時間的投入在

858
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:35,971
這款產品上你已經

859
00:43:35,971 --> 00:43:37,493
比別人領先一年兩年了

860
00:43:37,493 --> 00:43:37,593
那這個東西

861
00:43:39,061 --> 00:43:43,505
你能不能有效的保持這個壁壘

862
00:43:43,505 --> 00:43:45,647
或是說這個領先

863
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:48,770
直到別人有能力他跑過來超你

864
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:49,791
或是什麼的

865
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:52,573
或是說當你今天把這個案子提給發行商的時候

866
00:43:52,573 --> 00:43:56,296
發行商說你這個團隊提的案子不錯

867
00:43:56,296 --> 00:43:57,978
可是我有另外一個更適合的團隊

868
00:43:57,978 --> 00:43:59,099
他們也提了一樣的案子

869
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:00,580
那兩相比較之下

870
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,241
我決定給另外一個團隊

871
00:44:02,842 --> 00:44:06,564
A good example is always things like very distinct art style,

872
00:44:06,564 --> 00:44:08,604
difficult to replicate, right?

873
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,905
Just your art style.

874
00:44:09,905 --> 00:44:12,886
Very hard technical problems that you

875
00:44:12,886 --> 00:44:14,387
happen to have solved that's just

876
00:44:14,387 --> 00:44:18,788
like high barrier of entry for anyone else to replicate.

877
00:44:20,814 --> 00:44:30,716
那常見的幾種優勢,譬如說一個很有獨特性的畫面風格,這個東西可能是很個人的,所以別人很難抄你,或是抄了也抄不像,那或者是說有非常難的技術問題你已經解決了,那別人要花時間來解決。

878
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:53,256
And then the last point, which I called stretch goal,

879
00:44:53,256 --> 00:44:57,819
is basically what happens if your game is successful?

880
00:44:57,819 --> 00:45:03,103
What happens if your game happens to be a really big hit,

881
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:07,706
and now you need to deliver more content?

882
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:09,847
You have to somehow milk that game more.

883
00:45:09,847 --> 00:45:12,669
You have to make it bigger, sell it to more.

884
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:17,173
So if it goes well.

885
00:45:18,402 --> 00:45:23,843
What is your idea to make it even bigger, to grow it even more?

886
00:45:23,843 --> 00:45:30,145
Ask your team where you could take it further

887
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:31,745
那最後一點是

888
00:45:31,745 --> 00:45:35,426
可能看起來表面上會覺得比較奇怪,這是什麼

889
00:45:35,426 --> 00:45:38,447
他其實就跟Kickstarter的延伸目標是一模一樣的概念

890
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:42,468
就是如果你的專案真的超級成功

891
00:45:42,468 --> 00:45:44,508
那你現在想要從這個專案上面

892
00:45:45,438 --> 00:45:46,479
去表現更多東西

893
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:47,820
你想要放更多東西進去

894
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,860
你有沒有東西可以放

895
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,522
你有沒有適合的團隊可以做

896
00:45:51,522 --> 00:45:53,664
把遊戲在成功的情況下

897
00:45:53,664 --> 00:45:54,605
它可以繼續擴展

898
00:45:54,605 --> 00:45:56,246
可以延伸你的成功

899
00:45:56,246 --> 00:45:59,108
擴大你的成功等級的這種條件

900
00:45:59,108 --> 00:46:00,169
所以這個轉換方式

901
00:46:00,169 --> 00:46:01,670
也就是你最低的產品

902
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:02,531
當然你會有這個超大視界

903
00:46:02,531 --> 00:46:02,711
超級遊戲

904
00:46:02,711 --> 00:46:04,392
MMO 所有的模擬

905
00:46:04,392 --> 00:46:04,632
但是

906
00:46:04,632 --> 00:46:05,453
實際上你可能要做

907
00:46:15,989 --> 00:46:20,011
like cut that down to a point where

908
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:22,372
it's reasonable to make

909
00:46:22,372 --> 00:46:23,772
and then that is your scope

910
00:46:23,772 --> 00:46:24,573
that is your budget

911
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,673
that is what you're pitching

912
00:46:25,673 --> 00:46:28,234
and then the grand vision is

913
00:46:28,234 --> 00:46:30,055
is in the back of your mind

914
00:46:30,055 --> 00:46:32,936
in case you

915
00:46:32,936 --> 00:46:35,777
you get successful with a core thing

916
00:46:35,777 --> 00:46:36,337
right

917
00:46:36,337 --> 00:46:37,018
那從這個角度來說

918
00:46:37,018 --> 00:46:38,838
另外一個面向就是

919
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,159
你也可以先想像就是說

920
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:41,359
如果我有一個

921
00:46:42,444 --> 00:46:43,864
我想到了一個非常大的目標

922
00:46:43,864 --> 00:46:46,125
我想到了一個可能要做十年才做完的東西

923
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:48,046
那你有沒有把它先濃縮成一個

924
00:46:48,046 --> 00:46:49,806
你絕對可以在短期內

925
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,787
在預算內執行出來的結果

926
00:46:51,787 --> 00:46:53,688
然後如果這個東西

927
00:46:53,688 --> 00:46:55,329
這個核心目標成功了

928
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:56,889
你才有機會

929
00:46:56,889 --> 00:47:00,451
去慢慢推向你的這個比較遠大的那個目標

930
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:04,152
那你有沒有這樣子的延伸的條件

931
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:07,313
Right, and I think we're coming to an end here.

932
00:47:07,313 --> 00:47:09,254
So the last part, the third part.

933
00:47:09,989 --> 00:47:13,291
is about what Ryan Clark calls hooks.

934
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:17,993
Hooks are things that are special about your game,

935
00:47:17,993 --> 00:47:25,156
like something that is not in lots of other games.

936
00:47:25,156 --> 00:47:28,557
So the idea is from fishing, right?

937
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:30,098
You hook a fish.

938
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:34,220
You catch the player's attention with the hooks.

939
00:47:35,994 --> 00:47:38,856
所以最主要的問題是

940
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,918
如果沒有特別的東西

941
00:47:42,918 --> 00:47:43,959
就不夠好玩

942
00:47:43,959 --> 00:47:45,740
因為沒有人會注意到

943
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:49,201
或者是沒有人會在乎

944
00:47:49,201 --> 00:47:51,002
那最後一點就是

945
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:52,443
我們要問的是說

946
00:47:52,443 --> 00:47:54,044
你自己覺得你的遊戲

947
00:47:54,044 --> 00:47:56,565
你的點子真正特別的地方在哪邊

948
00:47:56,565 --> 00:47:58,266
你有沒有足夠的

949
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,367
讓人家上鉤的這個條件

950
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:01,948
讓人家一看到就覺得說

951
00:48:01,948 --> 00:48:02,709
這個東西跟別人不一樣

952
00:48:02,709 --> 00:48:05,090
然後有辦法很快速的吸引別人進來

953
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:11,158
我們可以說這是遊戲的影子,就是一個hook,影是那個牽引的影。

954
00:48:30,271 --> 00:48:32,092
以那個《聖海迷航》為例的話

955
00:48:32,092 --> 00:48:33,452
當初《聖海迷航》在推出的時候

956
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:37,814
其實很少有水下的開放世界遊戲

957
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:42,176
那光把水下跟開放世界這兩點結合起來

958
00:48:42,176 --> 00:48:43,756
其實就已經是一個非常好的特色

959
00:48:43,756 --> 00:48:44,877
所以這個藍海的元素

960
00:48:44,877 --> 00:48:45,017
是來自一本書

961
00:48:45,017 --> 00:48:45,277
叫做《藍海》之類的

962
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:57,382
The idea is there are two types of markets.

963
00:48:57,382 --> 00:48:59,362
One is the red ocean and one is the blue ocean.

964
00:48:59,362 --> 00:49:02,363
The red ocean is where everyone else is competing

965
00:49:02,363 --> 00:49:04,423
with each other and there's a lot of blood in the water.

966
00:49:04,423 --> 00:49:05,724
That's why it's red.

967
00:49:05,724 --> 00:49:10,365
And the blue ocean is nobody has tried anything there yet.

968
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:12,626
Like it's just completely unexplored.

969
00:49:12,626 --> 00:49:17,987
So if you have, that's also very risky

970
00:49:17,987 --> 00:49:20,508
because maybe there are no fish there.

971
00:49:20,508 --> 00:49:22,548
So could be total failure.

972
00:49:22,548 --> 00:49:23,968
But if there are fish there.

973
00:49:24,213 --> 00:49:26,754
they are yours, there is no competition at all

974
00:49:26,754 --> 00:49:28,035
And so

975
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:33,038
It's a good idea to at least strive for that to find something that

976
00:49:33,038 --> 00:49:38,142
Which is where there is no competition at all

977
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,783
那藍海要素其實大家應該都聽過就是基本上是

978
00:49:40,783 --> 00:49:43,065
就是講市場的競爭性的問題就是

979
00:49:43,065 --> 00:49:47,087
你市場競爭性少就是藍海市場競爭性很激烈就是紅海

980
00:49:47,087 --> 00:49:49,209
那

981
00:49:49,209 --> 00:49:51,970
我要注意的一點是你

982
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:52,911
你看到的藍海是

983
00:49:53,997 --> 00:49:57,321
他是單純只是一片藍海底下都沒有魚

984
00:49:57,321 --> 00:49:59,204
還是他是藍海然後底下真的有魚可以釣

985
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,874
Uh, cyberpunk JLPGs.

986
00:50:16,874 --> 00:50:21,858
I think there's one or something like that is basically like three or five.

987
00:50:21,858 --> 00:50:25,240
Yeah, it's, it's, there are not many. It's,

988
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,582
it's not a very competitive thing, right?

989
00:50:27,582 --> 00:50:36,268
Yeah. Pray, uh, pray for the gods. There's just shadow of the Colossus.

990
00:50:36,268 --> 00:50:40,871
That's, that's it, I guess. Right. There's not, not a lot of competition.

991
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,312
I don't know your name in the corner,

992
00:50:43,312 --> 00:50:45,733
but the games that you're making,

993
00:50:45,733 --> 00:50:52,198
it's quite unique, like card battler, turn-based game.

994
00:50:52,198 --> 00:50:56,762
There are not a lot of games that you directly

995
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,683
compete against, right?

996
00:50:58,683 --> 00:51:03,227
So those are interesting to make.

997
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:05,849
Those are hooky by design.

998
00:51:08,388 --> 00:51:10,429
就是剛剛提到的這些例子

999
00:51:10,429 --> 00:51:12,310
我們剛剛其實已經重複講到很多例子了

1000
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:15,811
然後這些作品基本上

1001
00:51:15,811 --> 00:51:17,591
譬如說以Subnautica為例的話

1002
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:20,432
它當時出現的時候其實類似遊戲真的很少

1003
00:51:20,432 --> 00:51:21,953
然後如果你去用

1004
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:25,073
譬如說Cyberpunk JRPG去搜尋Steam的話

1005
00:51:25,073 --> 00:51:29,095
你會發現能夠列出來的遊戲數量也是很少的

1006
00:51:29,095 --> 00:51:32,416
那這些東西就是基本上它會

1007
00:51:32,416 --> 00:51:34,736
你光把這個定調定出來

1008
00:51:34,736 --> 00:51:36,777
它就已經是一個不錯的吸引人的項目了

1009
00:51:38,737 --> 00:51:42,018
And then the other two points, just for example,

1010
00:51:42,018 --> 00:51:46,620
are value innovation means you take something that exists,

1011
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:49,941
but you make it better for the customer.

1012
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:53,823
Not arbitrarily better, but you fix a problem

1013
00:51:53,823 --> 00:51:58,744
that the customer has by looking at the reviews of a game that

1014
00:51:58,744 --> 00:52:00,765
is similar, and everyone is complaining

1015
00:52:00,765 --> 00:52:02,846
it should have this one thing, or it shouldn't do this one

1016
00:52:02,846 --> 00:52:05,667
thing, and then you fix that one thing.

1017
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:06,927
That's value innovation.

1018
00:52:08,062 --> 00:52:09,863
然後星際力量就是

1019
00:52:09,863 --> 00:52:13,065
如果你有一個非常有名的作家

1020
00:52:13,065 --> 00:52:15,307
他在做你的作品

1021
00:52:15,307 --> 00:52:17,588
或者是有一個非常有名的藝術家

1022
00:52:17,588 --> 00:52:19,209
他在做你的作品

1023
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:23,412
就像是有一個人已經有

1024
00:52:23,412 --> 00:52:25,573
已經有名了

1025
00:52:25,573 --> 00:52:27,134
那價值創新的部分

1026
00:52:27,134 --> 00:52:27,975
主要是強調說

1027
00:52:27,975 --> 00:52:30,457
你有沒有去解決就是使用者

1028
00:52:30,457 --> 00:52:32,118
他真的想要的東西

1029
00:52:32,118 --> 00:52:34,039
或是他之前抱怨的東西

1030
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:37,361
那就是可能以前在這個特定遊戲類型

1031
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:40,945
某一個狀態或是某一個功能

1032
00:52:40,945 --> 00:52:43,026
都是被大家有點嫌惡的

1033
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:45,749
那你後來提出一個想法去做法

1034
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:46,789
去真的去把它做好

1035
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:48,711
那明星效益的部分就是

1036
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:52,734
如果你團隊裡面有一些很知名的

1037
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:55,357
譬如說寫手、很知名的畫家

1038
00:52:55,357 --> 00:52:58,119
那這些人他們就等於有點像是自帶流量

1039
00:52:58,119 --> 00:52:59,700
那他可以幫助你的遊戲

1040
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,322
直接有推廣的效果

1041
00:53:02,322 --> 00:53:04,684
或是有名的作曲家在你作曲的

1042
00:53:05,438 --> 00:53:06,519
a good thing, right?

1043
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:10,702
And so once you have your hooks, you list how many do you have,

1044
00:53:10,702 --> 00:53:13,544
like just total, like write all them down and count them.

1045
00:53:14,978 --> 00:53:19,421
And then for each of them, you have to check how valuable is that,

1046
00:53:19,421 --> 00:53:23,223
how unique or how strong do people care about that?

1047
00:53:23,223 --> 00:53:26,945
Because sometimes it's unique, but I don't know,

1048
00:53:26,945 --> 00:53:31,228
nobody cares about this specific thing, right? And the way to,

1049
00:53:31,228 --> 00:53:36,771
to test that or the way to, to, to see how, what the,

1050
00:53:36,771 --> 00:53:40,893
what the quality of the hook is, is, well, you can, you can go to like,

1051
00:53:41,721 --> 00:53:44,983
like a game show and show the hooks, right?

1052
00:53:44,983 --> 00:53:48,265
Or you can make an itch page and talk about the hooks.

1053
00:53:48,265 --> 00:53:54,029
Or just talk to people, pitch them your idea,

1054
00:53:54,029 --> 00:53:57,611
and see what keywords they react to.

1055
00:53:57,611 --> 00:54:00,793
What's the good, I don't know, social media.

1056
00:54:00,793 --> 00:54:02,914
Talk to your friends.

1057
00:54:02,914 --> 00:54:07,637
Test whether the hooks that you have are actually interesting.

1058
00:54:10,818 --> 00:54:13,240
我們剛講到上面這四點講完之後

1059
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,384
你應該就是可以把你覺得真的有優勢的這些

1060
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:20,806
就是可以讓人家上鉤的這些要素

1061
00:54:20,806 --> 00:54:21,907
每一個都列出來

1062
00:54:21,907 --> 00:54:24,370
那你到底有多少個像這樣的要素

1063
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:26,511
每一個要素各自的強度是多少

1064
00:54:26,511 --> 00:54:28,713
就評估這些要素的分量

1065
00:54:28,713 --> 00:54:31,996
評估這些要素這些吸引人的鉤子

1066
00:54:31,996 --> 00:54:33,517
這些鉤子的品質

1067
00:54:33,517 --> 00:54:33,678
然後

1068
00:54:34,489 --> 00:54:35,890
有了這些東西之後

1069
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:39,052
你要盡快地去用各種方式去嘗試

1070
00:54:39,052 --> 00:54:40,573
到底你的評估是正確還是錯的

1071
00:54:40,573 --> 00:54:42,334
譬如說你可以去參加

1072
00:54:42,334 --> 00:54:43,835
尤其早期版本去參加電玩展

1073
00:54:43,835 --> 00:54:46,117
那電玩展的玩家給你什麼反應

1074
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:49,639
你跟你的朋友 你跟你的同行討論

1075
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:51,461
他們給你什麼反應

1076
00:54:51,461 --> 00:54:52,501
那有沒有什麼關鍵字

1077
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:53,622
是他們會特別有反應到的

1078
00:54:53,622 --> 00:55:00,467
And then the final slide

1079
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:03,969
Well, there's one more but almost final slide

1080
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:07,331
is about marketing.

1081
00:55:07,331 --> 00:55:10,431
Because the way, again, marketing

1082
00:55:10,431 --> 00:55:12,712
is about saying the right words.

1083
00:55:12,712 --> 00:55:16,393
And so you have to know which ones are the right words, which

1084
00:55:16,393 --> 00:55:18,333
words are meaningless and which ones are magical.

1085
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:23,314
And so you want to communicate what

1086
00:55:23,314 --> 00:55:25,355
is unique about your game, the hooks about your game.

1087
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:27,075
You want to be able to communicate

1088
00:55:27,075 --> 00:55:30,216
those things in your trailer, on your store page.

1089
00:55:31,993 --> 00:55:35,274
in all your social media presence, in your press kit.

1090
00:55:35,274 --> 00:55:39,335
Because remember what Ed had on his slides earlier

1091
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:43,637
about what publishers say, what they are looking for in a pitch?

1092
00:55:43,637 --> 00:55:45,817
They look for the hooks.

1093
00:55:45,817 --> 00:55:49,879
They look for what is unique about the game, right?

1094
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:52,839
So the better you can communicate that,

1095
00:55:52,839 --> 00:55:55,680
the easier it is to pitch your game both to a publisher

1096
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,221
as well as to a publisher.

1097
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:00,080
還有直接向客戶發送

1098
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,923
這都來自於

1099
00:56:03,923 --> 00:56:08,687
你把遊戲的特色

1100
00:56:08,687 --> 00:56:08,907
傳達給客戶

1101
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,889
最後就是跟影子的這個相關的議題

1102
00:56:11,889 --> 00:56:13,711
就是你要怎麼把這些影子推廣

1103
00:56:13,711 --> 00:56:15,913
什麼行銷這些東西出去

1104
00:56:15,913 --> 00:56:15,933
那

1105
00:56:16,995 --> 00:56:20,337
在行銷方面來說,很多時候最重要的就是說

1106
00:56:20,337 --> 00:56:23,318
這些影子可能都是可以用一些關鍵字來呈現

1107
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:25,219
那你到底是不是找到正確的關鍵字

1108
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:29,521
哪些關鍵字是有效的,哪些關鍵字是你講了也沒有人有感覺,是無效的

1109
00:56:29,521 --> 00:56:33,142
那前面的發行商提到的這些

1110
00:56:33,142 --> 00:56:35,503
他們在看的東西,剛剛發行商有給一些舉例

1111
00:56:35,503 --> 00:56:39,245
那他們在看的這些東西,其實最主要就是呈現這些

1112
00:56:40,169 --> 00:56:43,311
Can you show these hooks to the publishers?

1113
00:56:43,311 --> 00:56:45,812
Then the publishers will think,

1114
00:56:45,812 --> 00:56:47,993
Oh, this is really interesting.

1115
00:56:47,993 --> 00:56:49,273
I've never seen it before.

1116
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:50,974
Or this is really better than what I've seen before.

1117
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:53,475
Then you can go and see things like

1118
00:56:53,475 --> 00:56:56,517
how people in this promotional video

1119
00:56:56,517 --> 00:56:59,618
How to go to the marketing point

1120
00:56:59,618 --> 00:57:03,620
Then how do you want to convey your game's features

1121
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,861
on the store page, etc.

1122
00:57:05,861 --> 00:57:06,361
And so Ryan

1123
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:10,477
The guy from the beginning, he goes as far as being like,

1124
00:57:10,477 --> 00:57:13,899
if he cannot describe the hook, if he cannot communicate

1125
00:57:13,899 --> 00:57:17,941
the hook, then he's not going to make that game.

1126
00:57:17,941 --> 00:57:23,283
He has to be able to figure out how to describe it in a way

1127
00:57:23,283 --> 00:57:28,045
that you get it, like within one sentence or very shortly,

1128
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:33,887
in order to know that this hook will be meaningful,

1129
00:57:33,887 --> 00:57:36,528
will has a chance to work.

1130
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,588
所以像一開始我們提到那個就是 Ryan Clark 這個人

1131
00:57:40,588 --> 00:57:42,108
他講過類似的主題的時候

1132
00:57:42,108 --> 00:57:44,449
他有提到一個很重要的觀念是

1133
00:57:44,449 --> 00:57:47,350
有時候你會有好的影子 你會有好的 hook

1134
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:49,211
可是你不知道怎麼講

1135
00:57:49,211 --> 00:57:51,912
你不知道怎麼把這個 hook 丟出去

1136
00:57:51,912 --> 00:57:54,553
那基本上這個 hook 就等於沒有用

1137
00:57:54,553 --> 00:57:56,474
所以你不能只是說我有一個很好的點子

1138
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:58,715
我在我腦中覺得他很好

1139
00:57:58,715 --> 00:58:00,496
這有點像 這是額外的舉例

1140
00:58:00,496 --> 00:58:00,796
剛剛翻譯沒有講

1141
00:58:02,048 --> 00:58:05,309
譬如說我們以前剛開始在推廣VR的時候

1142
00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:07,690
很大的一個問題就是VR大家眼睛看得到

1143
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:08,530
你要親自戴

1144
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:09,951
可是你沒有辦法用講的

1145
00:58:09,951 --> 00:58:11,951
用嘴巴說VR到底像什麼東西

1146
00:58:11,951 --> 00:58:13,411
給人家什麼感覺

1147
00:58:13,411 --> 00:58:16,912
所以像那樣子的情況就很像是那種

1148
00:58:16,912 --> 00:58:17,673
你有好的點子

1149
00:58:17,673 --> 00:58:19,933
你有好的東西可以給人體驗

1150
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:21,073
可是你講不出來

1151
00:58:21,073 --> 00:58:22,454
你沒有辦法做宣傳片

1152
00:58:22,454 --> 00:58:25,235
那這個東西它就在宣傳這個hook上面

1153
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:25,955
會有一個很大的障礙

1154
00:58:25,955 --> 00:58:29,096
And that brings us to the last slide

1155
00:58:29,096 --> 00:58:30,416
And so this is also

1156
00:58:31,937 --> 00:58:37,742
One thing that I find really, like when I first heard that,

1157
00:58:37,742 --> 00:58:38,763
it made sense to me.

1158
00:58:38,763 --> 00:58:43,447
Because all you have to do, I think

1159
00:58:43,447 --> 00:58:45,830
you can forget about everything I just said,

1160
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:48,172
because it all is in this one question.

1161
00:58:48,172 --> 00:58:51,855
Sit down and ask yourself, what will the game

1162
00:58:51,855 --> 00:58:55,158
be the number one in the world?

1163
00:58:55,158 --> 00:58:56,939
And this is not, I mean it.

1164
00:58:56,939 --> 00:58:59,321
Like, what will it be number one?

1165
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:05,058
那就是如畫面上講的一樣

1166
00:59:05,058 --> 00:59:07,580
就是你在最後評估的時候

1167
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,821
你可以把前面那些問題

1168
00:59:08,821 --> 00:59:10,082
如果你覺得太繁瑣

1169
00:59:10,082 --> 00:59:11,623
你記不得那也沒差

1170
00:59:11,623 --> 00:59:13,604
重點是最關鍵的一個問題

1171
00:59:13,604 --> 00:59:15,625
你到底你在做的這款遊戲

1172
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:17,606
你想要做的這款遊戲

1173
00:59:17,606 --> 00:59:19,067
在哪一方面可以做到

1174
00:59:19,067 --> 00:59:20,708
真正做世界第一

1175
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:21,869
因為你可以說

1176
00:59:21,869 --> 00:59:22,950
這不一定是第一名

1177
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:24,071
我只是一個獨立的人

1178
00:59:24,071 --> 00:59:24,791
我沒有機會是第一名

1179
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:25,191
但這不正確

1180
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:35,157
The easiest way to be an expert in your field is to pick a very small field.

1181
00:59:35,157 --> 00:59:41,801
And so you can be the number one in a very, very small field.

1182
00:59:41,801 --> 00:59:46,524
Okay, depending on your scope.

1183
00:59:46,524 --> 00:59:49,806
But for example, Ed is making a cyberpunk JRPG.

1184
00:59:49,806 --> 00:59:57,491
He has a real chance to be the number one cyberpunk JRPG in the world with that game.

1185
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:05,116
因為它不會打敗Dark Souls或GTA7

1186
01:00:05,116 --> 01:00:09,257
但它絕對可以打敗所有其他虛擬實境RPG

1187
01:00:09,257 --> 01:00:13,159
這是一個非常強大的...

1188
01:00:13,159 --> 01:00:14,559
你很容易可以溝通到這一點

1189
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:15,359
這就是你的任務

1190
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,860
這就是你想要達成的

1191
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:17,200
所以...

1192
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,160
你先說

1193
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,341
所以你在問這個問題的時候

1194
01:00:20,341 --> 01:00:21,041
你可能會有點...

1195
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:21,822
你可能會有點疑問是說

1196
01:00:29,486 --> 01:00:30,727
我的團隊就這麼小

1197
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:32,867
就算我覺得我的遊戲哪邊地方很突出

1198
01:00:32,867 --> 01:00:34,968
但是它一定不會是世界第一

1199
01:00:34,968 --> 01:00:37,649
但是Jonas是覺得說

1200
01:00:37,649 --> 01:00:38,790
這樣的想法其實就是錯的

1201
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:40,571
你應該就算是很小的團隊

1202
01:00:40,571 --> 01:00:41,831
很小的作品

1203
01:00:41,831 --> 01:00:42,771
你也應該要去思考

1204
01:00:42,771 --> 01:00:47,013
那它在什麼樣很針對性

1205
01:00:47,013 --> 01:00:48,234
很小的範圍裡面

1206
01:00:48,234 --> 01:00:50,975
它真的是可以做到世界第一

1207
01:00:50,975 --> 01:00:53,576
對 就是有這樣子的點子

1208
01:00:53,576 --> 01:00:56,897
有這樣子的遊戲才是真正有機會

1209
01:00:56,897 --> 01:00:58,238
就是從那邊再擴展出來的

1210
01:00:59,078 --> 01:01:01,080
因為你可以有機會在那個小圈圈裡面

1211
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,022
真的把其他的所有的對手都打敗

1212
01:01:04,022 --> 01:01:05,723
或是那邊真的是你第一個到的地方

1213
01:01:27,816 --> 01:01:29,337
他們是世界上第一的遊戲

1214
01:01:29,337 --> 01:01:37,182
只要你把它做得夠小 或是做得夠精準

1215
01:01:37,182 --> 01:01:40,004
就是Jonas是說你可以想辦法

1216
01:01:40,004 --> 01:01:41,485
找一下比如說今年會上市的所有遊戲

1217
01:01:41,485 --> 01:01:45,068
然後你把表現特別好的都挑出來

1218
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:45,988
你大概都可以

1219
01:01:45,988 --> 01:01:47,629
就是如果你真的仔細去分析的話

1220
01:01:47,629 --> 01:01:49,991
你夠聚焦的去看每個遊戲的話

1221
01:01:49,991 --> 01:01:52,352
你應該都可以找到這一款遊戲

1222
01:01:52,352 --> 01:01:54,554
它在特定的一個很小的面向

1223
01:01:55,536 --> 01:02:00,117
不一定是全面,就是一個特定的很小面向,他也許就真的是世界第一。

1224
01:02:00,117 --> 01:02:03,038
那也是因為這點他才真的做的,他才可以有這樣子的成績。

1225
01:02:03,038 --> 01:02:13,600
And yeah, if you have that, that's your goal, that's your mission, that's what your team understands, that's what you're building, right? Then you have clarity.

1226
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:20,042
對,那如果你能夠找到這個點的話,基本上那就是,這是你要做的事情,這也是你的團隊要一起做的事情。

1227
01:02:20,042 --> 01:02:22,082
就是你們整個公司或整個團隊必須要。

1228
01:02:24,806 --> 01:02:25,946
一起前進的方向

1229
01:02:25,946 --> 01:02:27,327
那你的目標就會非常明確

1230
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,628
That's the talk, yeah. Thank you.

1231
01:02:30,628 --> 01:02:31,189
好 那感謝

1232
01:02:31,189 --> 01:02:36,911
We are way overtime, right?

1233
01:02:36,911 --> 01:02:38,491
Yeah, we are way overtime.

1234
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:40,592
Do we even have time for questions?

1235
01:02:40,592 --> 01:02:43,734
I guess we'll just open to the

1236
01:02:43,734 --> 01:02:46,675
or we'll try to open up for some questions

1237
01:02:46,675 --> 01:02:48,475
if anyone has any

1238
01:02:48,475 --> 01:02:50,476
就是如果有任何人現在想要直接提問的話

1239
01:02:50,476 --> 01:02:50,936
也可以直接

1240
01:02:51,547 --> 01:02:52,987
就提出來 那如果沒有的話

1241
01:02:52,987 --> 01:02:55,328
我們等一下就直接進入

1242
01:02:55,328 --> 01:02:58,769
就是會後的交流閒聊時間

1243
01:02:58,769 --> 01:03:00,270
因為其實這場本來沒有要講那麼久

1244
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:04,031
不好意思

1245
01:03:04,031 --> 01:03:04,091
好

1246
01:03:04,091 --> 01:03:05,812
那看起來應該等一下就大家私下討論啦

1247
01:03:05,812 --> 01:03:07,632
OK嗎

1248
01:03:07,632 --> 01:03:11,874
好 那就感謝大家今天來參加我們這個

1249
01:03:11,874 --> 01:03:14,455
10月底的獨立遊戲開發者分享會

1250
01:03:14,455 --> 01:03:16,975
那我們11月底預定也還會再有一場

1251
01:03:16,975 --> 01:03:20,036
