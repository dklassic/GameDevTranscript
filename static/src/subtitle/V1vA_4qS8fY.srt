1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:09,000
好,那我們最開始先請今天的團人先跟各位介紹一下他們自己

2
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:35,750
And I've been here for maybe 4 or 5 years.

3
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,651
I'm originally from California.

4
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:43,331
I studied in Hawaii.

5
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:50,013
So I've internalized the online game of Deceit,

6
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:52,714
which is an online multiplayer game.

7
00:00:52,714 --> 00:00:57,034
And pretty much you have a bunch of good guys together,

8
00:00:57,034 --> 00:00:57,655
and there's bad guys among you.

9
00:00:57,655 --> 00:00:59,395
You have to find them, kill them.

10
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:00,655
That's how you do it.

11
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:06,392
And other than that, yeah.

12
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:06,612
OK.

13
00:01:06,612 --> 00:01:09,194
Yeah, that's it.

14
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,836
OK, we'll get back to you.

15
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:16,720
We have more questions than that.

16
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,543
Hey, I'm Jonas.

17
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:20,723
I'm a programmer.

18
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:23,866
I was working on Subnautica, underwater adventure

19
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:26,348
game for PC and consoles.

20
00:01:26,348 --> 00:01:29,310
A colleague of mine is here right now.

21
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,591
He's also a programmer.

22
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:38,465
I also live in Taiwan, I've been here for a year, a little bit over a year now.

23
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,206
It's really nice.

24
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:44,268
Our current project, I mean Subnautica came out a year ago,

25
00:01:44,268 --> 00:01:50,412
and our current project is a follow-up game called Subnautica Below Zero.

26
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:53,574
It's very similar to the first one.

27
00:01:53,574 --> 00:01:57,897
It's a separate game, it's not DLC, right?

28
00:01:57,897 --> 00:01:58,177
It's a...

29
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:06,312
We think of it as a stand-alone expansion, because we don't want to call it Subnautica 2.

30
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:08,933
It's more like Subnautica 1.5 or something.

31
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,194
But yeah, it is not a DLC.

32
00:02:11,194 --> 00:02:16,236
And I'm originally from Germany.

33
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:21,979
Hello, I'm Fernando. I've been in Taiwan for three years now.

34
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:23,920
I'm working on a multiplayer...

35
00:02:30,044 --> 00:02:34,328
And I'm originally from the United States,

36
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:36,770
but grew up in Germany, actually.

37
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,092
And yeah, I went to school at the University of Texas,

38
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,755
Austin, computer science as sort of my technical background.

39
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:44,837
And I've been working on this game for quite a while.

40
00:02:44,837 --> 00:02:45,577
But it's not out yet.

41
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:46,478
Soon, though.

42
00:02:46,478 --> 00:02:46,658
How long?

43
00:02:46,658 --> 00:02:47,719
How long can you go?

44
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,080
At least six years.

45
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,464
I think it's getting closer to seven maybe,

46
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,666
I'll have to calculate it.

47
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:56,147
But yeah, a long time.

48
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:05,410
All the time you have been in Taiwan, right?

49
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,692
Three and a half years of it in Taiwan.

50
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:15,113
We came here for half a year, left, and came back.

51
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:18,354
So most of it in Taiwan, actually.

52
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:18,594
Okay.

53
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:19,094
Nice.

54
00:03:19,094 --> 00:03:21,875
Since Ed isn't here yet, there is another...

55
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,576
We have another speaker.

56
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:25,756
He's probably just...

57
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:26,636
Is it on?

58
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:27,597
Yeah, I think it's on.

59
00:03:27,597 --> 00:03:28,617
Sorry.

60
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:29,577
It ducks in and out.

61
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:29,657
Yeah.

62
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:35,915
那我們還有一位就是語壇人

63
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,595
那就是等他來的時候我們再請他來致接

64
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:43,537
那所以我下一個問題想要請教他們的是

65
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:46,317
就是說因為他們都有各自不同的背景

66
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:52,219
那想說就是也是來台灣也是一段時間

67
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:55,820
那他們自己在原本的國家或是社群

68
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,740
他們在那邊看到的跟在這邊看到的有什麼不一樣

69
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:08,777
So my next question is, what was your expectation of the game development scene in Taiwan before and after you came here?

70
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:20,381
Before you actually thought of doing a long stay or trying to settle down in Taiwan, did you expect there is a game development scene that you want to participate in?

71
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:27,163
And what are your expectations of the game development scene in Taiwan?

72
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:35,665
was and did that change after you actually set it up here?

73
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:43,067
And also like, maybe we can talk about the differences that you see from other parts of the world.

74
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,427
You can start.

75
00:04:44,427 --> 00:04:45,947
Ed just arrived.

76
00:04:45,947 --> 00:04:46,747
Oh yeah, okay.

77
00:04:46,747 --> 00:04:50,908
Just in time for it.

78
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:51,468
Sorry, sorry.

79
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:51,608
Yay!

80
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:54,589
Definitely never been here before.

81
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:56,749
Now Ed has been here like for many times.

82
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,282
Yeah, but is it... yeah, please.

83
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:14,568
Hi, I'm Ed. I'm a game developer. I just moved here.

84
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:17,850
I'm making a Japanese-style RPG.

85
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,352
And doing contract stuff as well, so...

86
00:05:21,352 --> 00:05:21,692
Bye.

87
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:23,693
Okay. Nice. Yeah, we'll get back to you.

88
00:05:23,693 --> 00:05:27,575
So, it's all about... how about you start with...

89
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,645
I didn't have much of an idea, really no idea what the dev scene would be like in Taiwan.

90
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:44,691
The only dev scene I really know, and honestly I don't know it that well because I've always been a bit of a hermit,

91
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:48,735
I think I know the Taiwan better was back in Austin, Texas.

92
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:55,541
I assumed that there was one, and Taiwan's a big country, and Taipei's the capital.

93
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:59,544
But until my wife sort of got me to leave...

94
00:06:01,505 --> 00:06:03,566
I had no clue what it was like.

95
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:10,909
Now, to compare the two, though, I was pleasantly surprised.

96
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:17,093
I think that I feel more comfortable in the Taiwan

97
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:20,134
dev scene than I did in Austin.

98
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:22,735
I love Austin, so if anybody here is back home, I love it.

99
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:27,378
I was there since 96, so I have a lot of roots there.

100
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:28,538
But I think

101
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:39,493
and I felt everybody really approachable here.

102
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:44,317
You know, I have a big handicap that I don't speak Mandarin pretty much at all,

103
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:47,099
but without Amanda translating for me.

104
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:50,782
But a lot of people speak English, and even when people didn't speak English,

105
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:55,786
you know, they really went out of their way to talk to me and to connect.

106
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:58,549
So my experience has been really great, actually.

107
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:01,391
And I've been a lot, you know, every month.

108
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:06,423
you know, since I work from home, I think a lot of us, probably not all of us,

109
00:07:06,423 --> 00:07:11,486
you know, it's every time there's some indie meetup,

110
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:14,667
you know, every month I always make sure I go there because

111
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,188
it really helps a lot,

112
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:24,812
even if you have communication barriers, just to be with other people who are going through what you're going through and to talk about, and also

113
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:28,273
before that, the only real socialization that I did was through

114
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:29,694
Discord, so it's been a big help.

115
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:30,875
And actually my game has...

116
00:07:31,353 --> 00:07:36,215
I've gotten a lot of good ideas from talking to people here in Taiwan.

117
00:07:36,215 --> 00:07:41,936
So it's been really great. So I'm really happy to be a part of the community.

118
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:43,317
So what was...

119
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:49,638
Do you know even, or any game that you think is from Taiwan before you came here?

120
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:52,399
Before I came here?

121
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,459
Honestly, no. I know it all.

122
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:54,540
But no, I did not...

123
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,221
Maybe some game that I played was from here and I didn't realize it was from Taiwan.

124
00:07:59,221 --> 00:07:59,981
A lot of times it's...

125
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:04,355
It's easy to remember the game, but hard to remember who the developer was,

126
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:06,577
and let alone where they're from.

127
00:08:06,577 --> 00:08:08,099
But no, I didn't.

128
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,282
Oh, okay. Got it.

129
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,603
So, how about Jonas?

130
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:15,065
That's difficult to follow up, but Richard.

131
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:18,909
So, before I came here,

132
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:22,753
I was working from home and trying.

133
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:35,449
for about four years.

134
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:40,591
And I've lived in a lot of different countries.

135
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:42,292
And unfortunately,

136
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:46,014
I haven't been able to connect with any indie scene

137
00:08:46,014 --> 00:08:51,916
in any other country, but here it was very, very easy.

138
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,337
The only other indie scene...

139
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:21,485
I think that situation is in Germany too.

140
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:26,127
People think if you're a programmer, you should do business and programs.

141
00:09:26,127 --> 00:09:27,088
Yes, yes, absolutely.

142
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:30,569
We have a very startup, unfriendly culture in Germany.

143
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:34,392
It's very, very difficult to create a company.

144
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:38,134
It needs a lot of money and lawyers and all that stuff.

145
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:43,076
And then once you have a company, and you hire someone,

146
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:47,138
it's very, very difficult to fire that person.

147
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:49,452
And you have to pay them a lot of money.

148
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:54,314
And so it's like if you have any kind of risk in your startup,

149
00:09:54,314 --> 00:09:56,895
and that's what startups are about,

150
00:09:56,895 --> 00:10:00,236
then Germany is a terrible place.

151
00:10:00,236 --> 00:10:05,818
And we also have laws that we just don't accept certain jobs.

152
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:09,619
You simply cannot be that job because it's not

153
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:13,201
on the list of acceptable jobs to be.

154
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:17,002
So in Germany, we really only have.

155
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:21,920
like one, we used to have one big game studio,

156
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,762
which was Crytek, they are doing Far Cry,

157
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:26,304
you might have heard of that,

158
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:28,766
but I'm not sure if they are around anymore,

159
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:30,927
or if they closed down.

160
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:33,850
And then we had a few, like,

161
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,791
web game developers, right?

162
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:39,875
And maybe they transitioned now to mobile,

163
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,856
but we never really had a proper, like,

164
00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:47,681
computer game or console game industry at all.

165
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:52,588
Which is really weird.

166
00:10:52,588 --> 00:10:56,069
Maybe Germans are too practical?

167
00:10:56,069 --> 00:11:01,610
I think they are just too locked up in old ways.

168
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,611
Okay.

169
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:08,032
Like new things are not good in Europe.

170
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:10,772
We have a different kind of thinking.

171
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:15,433
I have a follow up with that though.

172
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:16,614
Gamescon is in Germany.

173
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:17,554
Yes, exactly.

174
00:11:17,554 --> 00:11:20,454
The biggest games convention in the world.

175
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:21,455
Yeah, in the world.

176
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:27,982
is in Germany, right? And board games are super huge in Germany.

177
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:30,864
Oh, Euro games. Euro games, yeah.

178
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:35,308
You've probably played the Settlers of Catan, right?

179
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:37,069
That's a German game.

180
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:42,955
And actually, most of these style of games are from Germany.

181
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:48,560
there is like an indie board game scene, I guess?

182
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,382
Or, I'm not sure if they are indie, because it's just,

183
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:54,182
it's literally just five guys,

184
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:57,684
and it's always the same five guys,

185
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,585
and they make all the games.

186
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,025
And, and, but yeah, for computer games,

187
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:02,826
it's, it's just terrible.

188
00:12:02,826 --> 00:12:02,966
Wow.

189
00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:04,466
There's one really big one.

190
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:05,227
Interesting one.

191
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:06,567
In space, the X series,

192
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:09,128
and they kind of kept space games alive.

193
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:09,268
Oh, so.

194
00:12:09,268 --> 00:12:10,389
ErgoSoft, is an,

195
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:11,929
Oh, right, right, right.

196
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:12,870
It's a big company.

197
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:17,377
So there's one funny thing going on in parts of like,

198
00:12:17,377 --> 00:12:21,499
in Europe, so Germany is a little bit part of that,

199
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:25,722
which is like, in Sweden they make these deep,

200
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:27,783
like simulator type of games, right?

201
00:12:27,783 --> 00:12:32,786
Like all the, what's the publisher of Pandora, no?

202
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:33,086
Paradox.

203
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:33,827
Paradox.

204
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:36,508
Paradox, yeah, Paradox Interactive, right?

205
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:41,071
And they make a certain type of game that is like,

206
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:53,134
And so there are some niches of games that we do make in Europe.

207
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:54,594
This, right? X. X series.

208
00:12:54,594 --> 00:12:58,016
I think maybe also Farm Simulator? I think that's also...

209
00:12:58,016 --> 00:12:59,937
Farm Simulator is actually from Switzerland.

210
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:02,578
Oh, that's from Switzerland. Okay. Well, that's awesome.

211
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:05,559
And they are doing quite well, right?

212
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:08,301
And then there's, I think, Euro Truck Simulator.

213
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:11,842
And I'm not sure if that comes from Poland or something.

214
00:13:11,842 --> 00:13:13,643
Factorio comes from Poland.

215
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:13,923
Or Czech...

216
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:16,739
Czech, Czech. I think.

217
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:32,248
So, it's basically, Germany is sitting in the middle of Europe, and France is doing well, and Poland is doing well, and Sweden is doing well, and Switzerland is doing well, and they are all making games.

218
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:37,631
And we don't, but we sit in the middle, so Gamescom is where we are.

219
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:41,454
But they all come to your country, for Gamescom.

220
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,315
And of course it's a big market, right?

221
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:55,554
The point that I'm trying to make is once I came here, Subnautica just came out and

222
00:13:55,554 --> 00:14:00,917
I was like, okay, I should probably take what I learned in Subnautica and go to my conferences

223
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:02,518
and talk a little bit about that.

224
00:14:02,518 --> 00:14:07,541
And I Googled and I found, the first thing I found was TGF.

225
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,803
So I have no idea what that is.

226
00:14:09,803 --> 00:14:12,604
I wrote an email, I submitted my talk.

227
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:28,941
TGF was my first talk conference, and after that I was in lots of other conferences,

228
00:14:28,941 --> 00:14:32,822
none of them was as good as TGF.

229
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:35,783
You got something really good here, treasure it.

230
00:14:35,783 --> 00:14:37,083
I should stop talking.

231
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:45,006
So, I've lived in Taiwan for a few years now, and before I came up here,

232
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:51,748
I didn't really think about making a game specifically for the...

233
00:14:57,033 --> 00:15:00,656
I just thought, everyone's just doing mobile these days.

234
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:03,758
And over time, I realized that although it is a large market,

235
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:04,819
I was also very wrong.

236
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:07,321
There's still a lot of people that do PC.

237
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:12,185
You have the gaming centers all over the place.

238
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:13,606
And I had one, by the way.

239
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:16,789
And I made the first one in South Carolina a long time ago.

240
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:18,771
So I'm very interested in these.

241
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:23,414
And people don't go there and they play mobile games together.

242
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:24,916
They play PC games.

243
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:25,957
And so, yeah, the market's still very big.

244
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:33,858
Big here, and especially in not just Taiwan, but China, too.

245
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:40,081
You see Tencent that has 250 million people in one locale,

246
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:45,203
which is pretty wild compared to Steam that has a scattered

247
00:15:45,203 --> 00:15:46,283
locale of 125 million.

248
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:50,225
And so, yeah, the scene is pretty big here,

249
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:51,545
all over this place.

250
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:55,106
And anyway, in

251
00:15:56,195 --> 00:16:03,438
Taiwan, we recently started translating our game to traditional Chinese.

252
00:16:03,438 --> 00:16:09,521
And this was only recently, because some people from Taiwan started playing our game.

253
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:16,024
We saw them streaming on Twitch, and we see this and we suddenly notice that these people are playing our game.

254
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:19,045
It's completely in English. They're talking in Chinese.

255
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:24,927
They have this whole, like, their own custom-made wiki that they made with just all the translations and stuff.

256
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:25,628
And it's good.

257
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:32,541
You know, Taiwanese people are very passionate about this stuff.

258
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:38,283
And we started translating, and we're collaborating with some of these people.

259
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:39,644
And everyone's just so nice.

260
00:16:39,644 --> 00:16:46,226
And they just want the game in Chinese, and they're even happy to play it while it's still in English.

261
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:47,127
So that really surprised me.

262
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:55,270
So yeah, that's where we are at right now, is we want to get the game out for Eastern culture.

263
00:16:56,011 --> 00:16:59,872
and spread the word.

264
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:04,893
I think one point you bring up is that

265
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:08,975
a lot of people speak in Mandarin or Chinese

266
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:11,335
on the Throne of Light servers.

267
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:14,916
I think maybe one aspect of that is that

268
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,537
we have a lot of board game players

269
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,177
and board game

270
00:17:19,177 --> 00:17:22,478
developers here too.

271
00:17:22,478 --> 00:17:24,539
And like, werewolf kind of game

272
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:24,919
is...

273
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:26,554
like originally from those, right?

274
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:31,597
Yeah, the werewolf mafia genre itself was originally in,

275
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:34,459
came from Russia, is the farthest back in my research

276
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:35,459
that I could find.

277
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:38,521
And so from Russia, it went to the east.

278
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:43,784
And so what's funny about my game is that in Europe and...

279
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:49,671
United States, Australia, I have to really deeply explain what my game is, because it's

280
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:54,334
a tabletop game in disguise, and this genre is still very niche in this locale.

281
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:58,417
But in the eastern locale, it's not niche at all, and I had no idea.

282
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:04,961
Apparently there's some games that have millions of downloads of this genre.

283
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:10,705
I just need to tell people one sentence about the game, and they go, oh I know that genre,

284
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:11,445
I know that genre.

285
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:12,126
How is that even possible?

286
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:16,492
And so I was very shocked and of course pleased to hear this.

287
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:20,052
And so as soon as I learned about this stuff,

288
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:23,073
I should have researched it earlier.

289
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:27,474
But yeah, we're trying to get it out there.

290
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,874
Okay, nice.

291
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:30,134
And...

292
00:18:30,134 --> 00:18:35,335
Maybe next, like, Ed can follow up with

293
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:39,176
like, what was your expectations about Taiwan

294
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:41,636
or the game scene here before you came here

295
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:42,357
after you came here?

296
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:45,012
What were you doing back in UK?

297
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:48,173
Things like that.

298
00:18:48,173 --> 00:18:52,435
So when I was in the UK I used to work for a studio

299
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:56,736
called Mediasonic

300
00:18:56,736 --> 00:19:03,339
who make a bunch of mobile stuff and console stuff.

301
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:06,100
I was a server engineer there so I built

302
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,422
server side systems for multiplayer games and things.

303
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:17,386
Then I met my now wife who is Taiwanese and I came to visit her.

304
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:18,727
I think that was maybe...

305
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:21,888
Like two years ago?

306
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:23,729
That was three years ago.

307
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:24,570
Did I come to...

308
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,311
here then?

309
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:29,632
I don't think I did. I think I was way too...

310
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:30,833
Anyway, um...

311
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:35,855
So I used up all my holiday seeing her and then two...

312
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:44,660
see her again like less than a year later and have to wait for my vacation time from

313
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:54,004
work. I quit my job to work, like spend my savings working full time on my then hobby

314
00:19:54,004 --> 00:20:00,407
project which is Jack Move, my Japanese style RPG.

315
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:05,035
And then I kept coming back here for longer stretches.

316
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:09,639
And then came here, met Johnson and stuff.

317
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:17,205
I think my expectation before I came was that there wasn't much of an indie scene.

318
00:20:17,205 --> 00:20:24,971
And that's purely because I had a friend who worked in games, who lived in Taiwan.

319
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:32,784
maybe four or five years ago, and then he left because I don't think I've seen him at that time.

320
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:36,065
I don't know, were there that many game developers maybe?

321
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:41,267
That's the impression I got from him anyway.

322
00:20:41,267 --> 00:20:54,871
I think maybe the difficulty lies in the fact that it's hard for foreign game developers to get connected to the locals at first.

323
00:20:54,871 --> 00:20:55,992
Yeah, maybe.

324
00:20:56,673 --> 00:21:06,380
We really didn't reach out to the game developers who are living in Taiwan right now, maybe since just a few years ago.

325
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,642
He worked at a studio.

326
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:18,729
In studio, I think it tends to be a very closed environment for big companies in Taiwan.

327
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:22,692
I think that's the same in a lot of places as well.

328
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:24,834
In my hometown, that's why.

329
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:30,304
There's loads of indie developers. I come from Brighton in the UK.

330
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:35,548
There's a lot of bigger studios.

331
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:39,750
I used to run an indie meetup there.

332
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:47,175
All the indie developers would come, but people from the bigger studios would just stick to themselves.

333
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:54,200
They wouldn't really socialise outside of their company.

334
00:21:54,884 --> 00:21:58,765
I know UK has a pretty big indie scene too, right?

335
00:21:58,765 --> 00:21:59,025
Yes.

336
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:01,645
And Austin too.

337
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:06,606
I forgot to ask, is there any game developers in Hawaii though?

338
00:22:06,606 --> 00:22:07,947
Game developers? Yay!

339
00:22:07,947 --> 00:22:10,687
Game developers in Hawaii?

340
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:18,109
When I lived in Hawaii, I was mostly doing things for games instead of making my own games.

341
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:19,529
So I would do everything...

342
00:22:20,523 --> 00:22:22,925
surrounding actual game development.

343
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,466
So I used to do

344
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:27,729
stuff for Cyber Cafe Software and such.

345
00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:31,552
So I'm sort of unfamiliar, but

346
00:22:31,552 --> 00:22:37,317
I was very interested in eventually making a game, so I did keep my eye out,

347
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:38,237
and I did not see

348
00:22:38,237 --> 00:22:42,481
a single game developer during my stay. I was there for

349
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:42,801
years.

350
00:22:42,801 --> 00:22:45,183
I think the indie developer scene in Hawaii is

351
00:22:45,183 --> 00:22:45,783
pretty small.

352
00:22:50,427 --> 00:22:55,950
I was just interested in what's the situation in every...

353
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:56,451
from all your...

354
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:59,352
where you came from, basically.

355
00:22:59,352 --> 00:23:00,313
So...I guess next...

356
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:10,419
starting from the next questions, we are going to talk a little bit more about

357
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:14,741
the actual game development challenges that

358
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:17,803
maybe you faced before, things like that.

359
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:22,080
我接下來會想要問的問題

360
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,160
就是我們有列舉的問題

361
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,422
那其中其實有一個會跟

362
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:29,063
其實蠻多獨立開發者都會遇到一樣的狀況

363
00:23:29,063 --> 00:23:33,885
就是說譬如你是一個剛開始做第一款遊戲的開發者

364
00:23:33,885 --> 00:23:38,306
那你要怎麼樣去找到你的第一個玩家族群

365
00:23:38,306 --> 00:23:40,747
或者是說你已經找到一個

366
00:23:40,747 --> 00:23:42,048
你覺得你已經找到一個市場

367
00:23:42,048 --> 00:23:47,470
可是你要怎麼樣用有限人力去跟這些人互動之類的

368
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:55,558
I think this is what I want to ask next.

369
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:06,546
Because they have a lot of games in their games,

370
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:14,972
and there are many types of games.

371
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:22,245
And I think most of you utilize Discord right now,

372
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:28,910
because I think Discord is a very great platform.

373
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:35,776
And I think we can have a comparison between you guys.

374
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:39,460
What did you do, and what you didn't do,

375
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,561
and this is how I do it.

376
00:24:41,561 --> 00:24:42,963
This kind of thing.

377
00:24:42,963 --> 00:24:45,945
So I guess maybe we can start from Jonas.

378
00:24:45,945 --> 00:24:46,085
Sure.

379
00:24:47,337 --> 00:24:50,239
What we didn't do was spend any money.

380
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:56,563
So we've been around for a very long time, like 15 years or something.

381
00:24:56,563 --> 00:25:00,466
I mean the studio that I'm working for, right?

382
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:04,328
And we tend to take a long time to make a single game.

383
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:21,279
And the way we work is we try to put as many information about what we are doing out there.

384
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:34,170
Like we put our daily task board, like we use travel to do task tracking, we put that public.

385
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,871
And we...

386
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,651
play them on Steam, right?

387
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:50,173
So we make our check-in messages publicly.

388
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:53,314
They go to Twitter.

389
00:25:53,314 --> 00:25:56,795
And by just being very open as a studio,

390
00:25:56,795 --> 00:25:59,977
we give lots of people the opportunity

391
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:03,798
to create something around what we were doing,

392
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:09,460
like make entertainment out of our process of making a game.

393
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,702
So we are seeing lots of people from the community.

394
00:26:14,385 --> 00:26:25,167
writing the wiki for us, or translating the game for us, or doing tech support for us

395
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:29,367
on the forums if someone has a problem.

396
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:39,449
Or if someone comes and is not happy, they help that person maybe solve that problem.

397
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:43,310
So we have a really...

398
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,671
big and very helpful, friendly community.

399
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:48,253
And I think the reason why we do have that

400
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:54,477
is because we are so transparent and open about everything

401
00:26:54,477 --> 00:26:54,697
we do.

402
00:26:54,697 --> 00:27:01,342
And we have a really good community manager guy

403
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:06,666
who keeps it very positive.

404
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:11,970
So I'll summarize this in Mandarin.

405
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:14,946
他們的公司Unknown World Entertainment

406
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:18,867
其實之前做過Natural Selection系列

407
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:21,928
然後其實那個就已經是好多年前的作品

408
00:27:21,928 --> 00:27:23,368
然後後來才又用

409
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:25,449
大概用同樣的開發方式

410
00:27:25,449 --> 00:27:28,049
他們其實有之前在GDC有講過

411
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:29,709
就他們的算是製作人有在GDC講過一個

412
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:33,730
叫做Open Development的演講

413
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,971
那就是那個時候是在講Natural Selection 2

414
00:27:37,971 --> 00:27:39,651
那後來他們也出了Subnautica

415
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:40,912
跟現在是出Below Zero這樣

416
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:46,451
那我接下來比較好奇的是

417
00:27:46,451 --> 00:27:48,152
就是他們當初最早

418
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:49,352
因為其實最...

419
00:27:49,352 --> 00:27:50,273
我覺得比較重要的是

420
00:27:50,273 --> 00:27:51,874
你一開始怎麼知道

421
00:27:51,874 --> 00:27:55,836
你要去engage某一群人

422
00:27:55,836 --> 00:27:56,897
這樣子的面向

423
00:27:56,897 --> 00:27:58,958
因為我想說如果你已經有一個

424
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,719
蠻大的玩家支持者群的話

425
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:03,541
其實理論上你後續要做什麼事情

426
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:04,501
是相對簡單一些

427
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:07,763
所以我想我接下來的問題是

428
00:28:07,763 --> 00:28:07,883
你怎麼...

429
00:28:09,931 --> 00:28:13,572
like first engaged, you know, the first group of people,

430
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:16,392
you know, maybe they play Natural Selection 1

431
00:28:16,392 --> 00:28:19,013
as a mod of Half-Life,

432
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:20,854
but they play Natural Selection 2.

433
00:28:20,854 --> 00:28:23,714
Like, did that community build up

434
00:28:23,714 --> 00:28:25,055
and carry over to the next game?

435
00:28:25,055 --> 00:28:26,435
Right, right, right.

436
00:28:26,435 --> 00:28:28,715
That's a good question.

437
00:28:28,715 --> 00:28:30,896
So, the very first game you just mentioned

438
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:32,316
is Natural Selection 1,

439
00:28:32,316 --> 00:28:34,817
which was a free mod for Half-Life.

440
00:28:34,817 --> 00:28:35,797
That was a competitive,

441
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,358
aliens vs. marines kind of shooter.

442
00:28:38,358 --> 00:28:38,618
And then,

443
00:28:39,523 --> 00:28:43,484
That mod was so popular that the people who made it

444
00:28:43,484 --> 00:28:46,745
decided to start a company and make that mod

445
00:28:46,745 --> 00:28:49,025
as a standalone product.

446
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:50,966
And that was called Natural Selection 2.

447
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:55,086
It was basically the same, but now as a standalone product

448
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:56,967
and for money.

449
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:59,707
And I'm sure that a good amount of the community that

450
00:28:59,707 --> 00:29:06,369
played the first game came in and then bought the second game.

451
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,289
However, what we put in.

452
00:29:12,095 --> 00:29:17,476
happen again. We had a big community from Natural Selection 2, they were not interested

453
00:29:17,476 --> 00:29:24,318
in Subnautica at all. And it kind of makes sense because Natural Selection is a competitive

454
00:29:24,318 --> 00:29:32,179
multiplayer shooter, Subnautica is a single player adventure diving game. There's very

455
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:38,801
little overlap in taste. So only super fans of our studio itself came over, but those

456
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:40,261
are very, very rare.

457
00:29:48,947 --> 00:29:50,348
And that took a long, long time.

458
00:29:50,348 --> 00:29:52,450
When we launched...

459
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,432
How long was it you were in Early Access?

460
00:29:55,432 --> 00:29:58,834
It was in Early Access three years.

461
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:00,656
Three years for Early Access?

462
00:30:00,656 --> 00:30:00,896
Yes.

463
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:04,519
And the launch on Early Access was terrible.

464
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:10,083
We wanted to have, I think, between 10,000 or 10,000 to 50,000 sales.

465
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:14,946
That was our Early Access launch goal.

466
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,308
I don't think we had hit 10,000.

467
00:30:17,978 --> 00:30:21,799
And then three years later, we sold a total of like 2 million.

468
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:27,061
So our early access launch compared to our final release,

469
00:30:27,061 --> 00:30:30,342
like all the sales that we made in between,

470
00:30:30,342 --> 00:30:33,122
was totally nothing.

471
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:37,063
And the community built up over time very, very slowly.

472
00:30:37,063 --> 00:30:41,564
So the big surge of sales is basically very close

473
00:30:41,564 --> 00:30:42,645
to the access.

474
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:52,094
Every single month, 5,000 people buy the game.

475
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:52,855
Okay.

476
00:30:52,855 --> 00:30:54,136
Basically.

477
00:30:54,136 --> 00:30:57,498
And it just keeps going and going.

478
00:30:57,498 --> 00:31:00,120
There's no end in sight.

479
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,180
Oh.

480
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:04,563
So you don't see like, maybe they are like stopping or like long tail right now.

481
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,945
It's just a very steady...

482
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:08,085
It's very, very steady, yeah.

483
00:31:08,085 --> 00:31:11,508
Because we were...

484
00:31:11,508 --> 00:31:12,728
We were releasing an update...

485
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,551
new cool feature in it.

486
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:23,072
And so what happens every time we make an update,

487
00:31:23,072 --> 00:31:26,514
we see a spike in our sales, and then there's

488
00:31:26,514 --> 00:31:27,955
the tail starting.

489
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:34,078
And then next month is spike and tail, and spike and tail.

490
00:31:34,078 --> 00:31:37,260
And because our update frequency is so high,

491
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,262
it never really goes totally down.

492
00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:45,324
It keeps at a pretty consistent level.

493
00:31:45,324 --> 00:31:45,544
I see.

494
00:31:46,765 --> 00:31:52,849
Dylan, can you also say something about this?

495
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:57,851
For throwing it, are you talking about the sales curve right now?

496
00:31:57,851 --> 00:31:59,112
In regards to the sales curve...

497
00:31:59,112 --> 00:32:01,693
How did you start? I know you actually talked about this...

498
00:32:01,693 --> 00:32:03,174
Oh, in the last time?

499
00:32:03,174 --> 00:32:07,116
Yeah, last time, but you can briefly talk about that again.

500
00:32:07,116 --> 00:32:10,458
I've learned some new things.

501
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:12,756
everything we funnel to Discord.

502
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:15,537
And we have a ramen noodles budget,

503
00:32:15,537 --> 00:32:19,538
and so what can you do except to bring it into Discord?

504
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:23,639
And so when Discord came out, I was one of the first

505
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:26,239
to realize that, oh man, this is like the ideal platform.

506
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:26,759
It has everything.

507
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,820
It has voice, chat, permissions.

508
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,841
We use it for both community and dev collaboration, too.

509
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:34,921
It's just a beautiful platform.

510
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:39,002
And so everything that you do, every announcement you make,

511
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:40,622
every landing page that you have.

512
00:32:41,247 --> 00:32:43,229
you funnel it to Discord.

513
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:47,292
And so you don't want to list all of your links, which

514
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:48,012
some people do.

515
00:32:48,012 --> 00:32:50,975
Lots of times, you just want to put one or two links.

516
00:32:50,975 --> 00:32:54,337
So maybe the link to your game and the link to your Discord.

517
00:32:54,337 --> 00:32:56,279
And in your Discord, that's where

518
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,760
you can have your whole list of things.

519
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,741
Because they're in your Discord.

520
00:32:58,741 --> 00:33:00,202
They're where you want them.

521
00:33:00,202 --> 00:33:04,425
So then make sure it's funneled there.

522
00:33:04,425 --> 00:33:07,367
And make sure that your welcome page in Discord,

523
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:09,689
like where your invite link goes to.

524
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:12,208
make sure it has a whole bunch of the most important things

525
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,029
you want them to do.

526
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:15,491
Don't just throw them in general chat.

527
00:33:15,491 --> 00:33:16,953
They'll get overwhelmed.

528
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,796
And they won't see what you want them to see.

529
00:33:20,796 --> 00:33:23,418
And most of the time, it's the important links,

530
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,741
and it's the little social sites or extras.

531
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:31,585
You want to point them to news.

532
00:33:31,585 --> 00:33:34,968
So what we do is we like to use discord.js API.

533
00:33:35,693 --> 00:33:38,035
And we run it on our Node server.

534
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:39,756
And it's just self-hosted.

535
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:40,757
We use DigitalOcean.

536
00:33:40,757 --> 00:33:42,638
And it's really easy to set up.

537
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:43,919
They have good documentation.

538
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,821
And so we use our bot very often for engagement.

539
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:51,465
And so we actually use Discord with in-game integration

540
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:52,465
as well.

541
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:56,508
And so in-game, we'll try to pull people into Discord, too.

542
00:33:56,508 --> 00:33:59,390
It'll show how many people are there.

543
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,032
There'll be a Discord button.

544
00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:04,180
In beta, we didn't have enough players.

545
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,921
It takes 16 players to make a game.

546
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:09,423
And so in alpha, beta, we were lucky to get eight,

547
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:11,004
which is our minimum.

548
00:34:11,004 --> 00:34:15,747
And so what we would do is we'd use our bot to announce.

549
00:34:15,747 --> 00:34:18,028
So whenever someone queued up for the game,

550
00:34:18,028 --> 00:34:22,531
you can imagine that there's only maybe five to 15 people

551
00:34:22,531 --> 00:34:24,532
on at a time back then.

552
00:34:24,532 --> 00:34:26,713
And so then it would ping Discord.

553
00:34:26,713 --> 00:34:30,115
You could join a roll and be pingable whenever someone

554
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:33,157
is together in matchmaking.

555
00:34:33,157 --> 00:34:37,859
And so after that, the bot would say, hey guys, everyone,

556
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:38,739
join up, join up.

557
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:41,840
Join this rank to be pinged for the future.

558
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,081
And so it would show a little embed.

559
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:46,062
It'd show how many players are there.

560
00:34:46,062 --> 00:34:48,103
And as the players go up to the minimum,

561
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:51,044
it would start hyping people up.

562
00:34:51,044 --> 00:34:54,245
And so it'd use little Unicode emojis and read,

563
00:34:54,245 --> 00:34:56,346
oh, it's there, just one more.

564
00:34:56,346 --> 00:35:00,408
And so it'd actually have a link where.

565
00:35:01,394 --> 00:35:02,694
You can make a Steam link.

566
00:35:02,694 --> 00:35:06,396
I forgot how it is offhand, but you can Google it.

567
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,076
You can make it a link, so it'll launch your application

568
00:35:09,076 --> 00:35:09,776
via your app ID.

569
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,177
And so that was really useful, too.

570
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:13,658
So you just click it, and if it's installed,

571
00:35:13,658 --> 00:35:16,658
it will launch the game.

572
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:21,000
And another thing we did later on is we made it so that it

573
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,301
would go to a special link where it would detect if you

574
00:35:24,301 --> 00:35:25,881
have Steam running.

575
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:28,002
If so, it would launch the game.

576
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:29,722
And if not, it would bring you to the store page.

577
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:35,461
So it was a really useful bot, which eventually got really annoying later

578
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:38,542
once we got tons of people and we were out of beta.

579
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:41,862
So we had to kill that feature off, but it's still dormant.

580
00:35:41,862 --> 00:35:43,603
Anything you can do to engage.

581
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:46,263
We have an overwhelming amount of channels,

582
00:35:46,263 --> 00:35:48,744
which we keep trying to shorten it,

583
00:35:48,744 --> 00:35:54,125
but we realize they all serve its purpose once you have a certain amount of people.

584
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:58,365
So eventually what we do is we have achievement section.

585
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,382
We don't have time for Steam achievements yet.

586
00:36:01,382 --> 00:36:02,242
It's a planned feature.

587
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:05,044
But if you're going to do it, you've got to do it right.

588
00:36:05,044 --> 00:36:07,586
You've got to have hundreds.

589
00:36:07,586 --> 00:36:11,369
And you've got to have your stat system perfectly set up.

590
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:15,972
So what we can do is the lazy way, I mean the temporary way,

591
00:36:15,972 --> 00:36:18,554
is to make an achievements channel in Discord.

592
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:22,377
And so we say, hey, if you have 500 hours played,

593
00:36:22,377 --> 00:36:24,098
we'll give you a special colored roll.

594
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,059
If you have 1,000 hours played, we'll

595
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,460
give you a shinier roll.

596
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,231
And we just have...

597
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:31,212
Can the score know that information through the API too?

598
00:36:31,212 --> 00:36:31,252
No.

599
00:36:31,252 --> 00:36:35,135
This one we actually do manually, but it's not bad.

600
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:40,819
And we just say you have to have a, you know, we just verify it through a public profile.

601
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:46,203
And if they're not public profile, you know, we can, we say that you can either...

602
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:47,584
Take a screenshot or something.

603
00:36:47,584 --> 00:36:51,607
You can, well, not screenshot, but we say that you either have to set it public so we

604
00:36:51,607 --> 00:36:54,849
can see that you have 500 hours or you can link to your review.

605
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:57,716
So one or the other will work.

606
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,238
We prioritized the first one to make sure

607
00:37:00,238 --> 00:37:03,661
that we're not biased for reviews.

608
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:06,623
So that seems to be working pretty well.

609
00:37:06,623 --> 00:37:09,466
What else for engagement?

610
00:37:09,466 --> 00:37:11,888
We have a feedback and bugs channel.

611
00:37:11,888 --> 00:37:12,868
This is really good.

612
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:16,692
We set up the bot so that any time somebody posts there,

613
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,873
we have a cool down to make sure you don't spam it.

614
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:21,275
Then the bot will put a thumbs up, thumbs down.

615
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:24,723
And all the other emojis we have disabled.

616
00:37:24,723 --> 00:37:29,907
And so people can vote on these ideas and bugs.

617
00:37:29,907 --> 00:37:32,169
If they've experienced it, they can thumbs up.

618
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:38,113
And over time, you realize that some people will spam thumbs

619
00:37:38,113 --> 00:37:40,335
down on people.

620
00:37:40,335 --> 00:37:43,938
So we made it Facebook-like, where it's only thumbs up.

621
00:37:43,938 --> 00:37:47,140
But if you want to, if you can handle the feedback, you can

622
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,461
type in hashtag.

623
00:37:48,983 --> 00:37:53,145
debate. And if you do that, then the thumbs down will show.

624
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,726
Yeah, so that seems to be working really well.

625
00:37:55,726 --> 00:38:00,548
So that way, if they truly want negative and positive unbiased feedback,

626
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:04,109
that works really well. And that's been really awesome, because

627
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:07,830
you can't implement every feature. You want to, but it's impossible.

628
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,972
So you want to go with people where it might seem like a good idea, but

629
00:38:11,972 --> 00:38:17,114
maybe only you think it's a good idea, and maybe only they think it's a good idea,

630
00:38:17,114 --> 00:38:18,175
and no one else likes the idea.

631
00:38:19,504 --> 00:38:24,507
So the emoji thumbs up, down count really

632
00:38:24,507 --> 00:38:25,848
assists on this matter.

633
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:29,371
Yeah, and Discord.

634
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:32,934
What you can do as well is, if you're not an official game

635
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:35,656
yet, make a memorable short URL.

636
00:38:35,656 --> 00:38:38,217
It's really easy to set a short URL service.

637
00:38:38,217 --> 00:38:39,759
Like ours is t-o-l-i-dot-e-s.

638
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:43,041
So you can just do something really short.

639
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:45,583
And you have to be partnered so that it can.

640
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:47,901
Am I right?

641
00:38:47,901 --> 00:38:52,364
For the official one, yeah, you do have to be partnered.

642
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:56,185
So our partner link is discord.gg slash T-O-L.

643
00:38:56,185 --> 00:39:00,867
But in the early days, I had my own short URL service,

644
00:39:00,867 --> 00:39:05,109
sort of like Bitly or Google's old one that they just

645
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:05,870
continue.

646
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,330
OK, yeah.

647
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:09,131
You can make your own, and then just put slash discord.

648
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:10,772
So that way, everyone remembers it.

649
00:39:10,772 --> 00:39:14,694
Because you want people to always remember easily

650
00:39:14,694 --> 00:39:16,074
where it is and where.

651
00:39:17,277 --> 00:39:20,918
你希望所有人都能夠加入,讓他們可以告訴朋友們

652
00:39:20,918 --> 00:39:25,200
他們知道Link by Heart,是一個很容易記得的東西

653
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,201
你不希望他們需要去看,因為如果他們被迷惑一分鐘

654
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:30,102
那個人就永遠不會加入

655
00:39:30,102 --> 00:39:31,162
明白,OK

656
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:36,084
那問一下現場有多少人的Discord是已經有

657
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:37,624
就是像用這種工具去做遊戲聯動

658
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:43,210
還沒有啊

659
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,451
你可以先問一下

660
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:48,472
有人是做Multiplayer遊戲的嗎

661
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:49,752
就是會需要譬如說要揪團的

662
00:39:49,752 --> 00:39:50,832
還是說要開台的那種

663
00:39:50,832 --> 00:39:52,953
Fernando

664
00:39:52,953 --> 00:39:53,333
OK

665
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:53,533
一個

666
00:39:53,533 --> 00:40:00,814
所以我猜Fernando可以跟Dylan一起說

667
00:40:00,814 --> 00:40:01,454
因為我覺得你們兩個

668
00:40:01,454 --> 00:40:02,695
在開始的時候

669
00:40:02,695 --> 00:40:05,315
就像是在Alpha版本的時候

670
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:05,615
你需要

671
00:40:12,425 --> 00:40:15,586
paying people in channel, this kind of thing,

672
00:40:15,586 --> 00:40:17,907
to actually get people to join your game.

673
00:40:17,907 --> 00:40:18,788
Yeah, so maybe, like...

674
00:40:18,788 --> 00:40:22,209
So I'll talk about how my experience has been with Discord,

675
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:22,910
what I've done to...

676
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,191
Or maybe how you've been playing games.

677
00:40:25,191 --> 00:40:29,613
How you did in the early days, what you did to get players.

678
00:40:29,613 --> 00:40:34,775
I'm still, I mean, I assume my community's probably a lot smaller.

679
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:40,298
I know it's a lot smaller, Subnautica's like 37,000 or something.

680
00:40:40,298 --> 00:40:40,698
And, uh, game...

681
00:40:40,698 --> 00:40:41,038
I think it's 15,000.

682
00:40:41,462 --> 00:40:44,724
It just grew here. Another 5,000 at least while we were here.

683
00:40:44,724 --> 00:40:48,326
And thrown at lies, how big is your community? 14,000.

684
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:50,026
14,000. I'm just a tiny little 280.

685
00:40:50,026 --> 00:40:56,269
But my experience, so I started six years ago.

686
00:40:56,269 --> 00:41:00,812
When I started, of course, Discord didn't exist.

687
00:41:00,812 --> 00:41:04,773
And at the very beginning it was just friends.

688
00:41:04,773 --> 00:41:08,635
Getting over to my house, sitting on the sofa, on the computer.

689
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:17,775
And we'd just get together on wireless keyboards, gamepads,

690
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,237
and play all over the local LAN.

691
00:41:20,237 --> 00:41:24,180
Eventually, after many times my number one, Gerald,

692
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,182
who's still with me, a very good friend of mine

693
00:41:28,182 --> 00:41:31,625
who's been playing since day one, he said, get this out there.

694
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:34,527
He was like, release it, launch it, launch it, release it.

695
00:41:34,527 --> 00:41:36,788
And so he encouraged me.

696
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:40,010
I did a teaser trailer a couple years ago.

697
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,513
I set up a website, set up forums, sent out emails.

698
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:50,841
and crickets chirping.

699
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:55,424
I think I was very fortunate that Joystick, it was literally

700
00:41:55,424 --> 00:41:58,386
like the day before they closed that website,

701
00:41:58,386 --> 00:42:00,267
they covered my video.

702
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:05,450
And I got a lot of people viewing it from there.

703
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:08,211
Mainly a lot of people being puzzled.

704
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:09,992
But you should look up the old video,

705
00:42:09,992 --> 00:42:13,534
because it looks nothing like what it looks like right now.

706
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:15,335
Can I just type Joystick?

707
00:42:15,335 --> 00:42:16,416
Joystick is closed.

708
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:17,466
uh...

709
00:42:17,466 --> 00:42:17,986
but you can type

710
00:42:17,986 --> 00:42:19,407
this one right here

711
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:21,787
yeah if you go to youtube

712
00:42:21,787 --> 00:42:22,187
and type

713
00:42:22,187 --> 00:42:23,808
hunter neck going to the trailers

714
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:26,008
you'll see the old trailer

715
00:42:26,008 --> 00:42:26,948
uh... but uh...

716
00:42:26,948 --> 00:42:28,189
but anyways

717
00:42:28,189 --> 00:42:29,789
so that got you know

718
00:42:29,789 --> 00:42:33,910
it went from like nothing to several thousand views

719
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:34,010
uh...

720
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:34,250
which one?

721
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,571
just type like

722
00:42:36,571 --> 00:42:38,151
hunter neck going to the trailers

723
00:42:50,243 --> 00:42:52,624
So there's the real one.

724
00:42:52,624 --> 00:42:53,124
Yeah, that one.

725
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:54,024
Somebody copied it.

726
00:42:54,024 --> 00:42:54,144
Yeah.

727
00:42:54,144 --> 00:42:56,405
So this one was the real one.

728
00:42:56,405 --> 00:42:59,467
GameTrailer's also covered it, but the one with thousands

729
00:42:59,467 --> 00:43:00,607
of views is a different one.

730
00:43:00,607 --> 00:43:02,768
But that'll show you the video.

731
00:43:02,768 --> 00:43:06,410
But anyways, my goal was to get people to play the game.

732
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:09,031
I did a Twitch stream and everything.

733
00:43:09,031 --> 00:43:11,832
And I went and posted it in different forums.

734
00:43:11,832 --> 00:43:14,973
If you skip a little bit forward, you'll see.

735
00:43:14,973 --> 00:43:15,934
You can see it.

736
00:43:15,934 --> 00:43:16,114
Yeah.

737
00:43:16,114 --> 00:43:19,175
That's the video right there.

738
00:43:19,175 --> 00:43:19,255
Yeah.

739
00:43:24,091 --> 00:43:28,414
Yeah, and I set up that website. So what did that accomplish?

740
00:43:28,414 --> 00:43:35,318
I got some weird, you know, interesting feedbacks and...

741
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:36,519
This is nothing like the game right now.

742
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:37,880
No, nothing, nothing.

743
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:43,424
This is completely different from the game now.

744
00:43:43,424 --> 00:43:44,164
There's a baby.

745
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:45,265
What is that?

746
00:43:45,265 --> 00:43:46,026
It's going in.

747
00:43:46,026 --> 00:43:47,346
It's disco balls.

748
00:43:47,346 --> 00:43:48,607
Yeah.

749
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:55,760
This is actually a funny video because these guys that work for one of the big sites, I

750
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,265
don't know who it was that did a series, and they did Halo and they did some other big

751
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:03,407
games besides mine.

752
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:10,633
But anyways, and then I went, for the teaser, basically those are players spawning.

753
00:44:10,633 --> 00:44:16,739
All those things you're seeing from the sky, and it's a server spawning 700 players all

754
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:17,680
in one instance.

755
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:24,619
Yeah, it's a street crawl. 7 times what Fortnite does, you know, 6 years ago.

756
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:31,941
With crazy physics and portals to different areas and all sorts of crazy...

757
00:44:31,941 --> 00:44:38,663
You can climb like Spider-Man, swing like the Titanfall, yeah, a lot of stuff.

758
00:44:38,663 --> 00:44:39,503
That's a swing.

759
00:44:39,503 --> 00:44:44,364
I realized I haven't showed your game on screen right now, I should show that.

760
00:44:44,364 --> 00:44:46,205
Yeah, you can look at it.

761
00:44:46,703 --> 00:44:52,927
And I mentioned bigger battles than any MMOFPS, so I got a lot of fans of Planetside, too.

762
00:44:52,927 --> 00:45:02,132
Saying, oh, but Planetside can do more players, and I say, but in a single battle, ugh.

763
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,413
Anyway, so I got some...

764
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:07,355
I did manage to get a handful of people to join my community.

765
00:45:07,355 --> 00:45:07,815
And...

766
00:45:07,815 --> 00:45:08,716
Maybe it's not the same.

767
00:45:08,716 --> 00:45:09,916
Now it's, you know, it's got a...

768
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,871
Now it's like Star Wars space theme.

769
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:20,493
But you can still see some of the weirdness in that third image where there's a top-down view and you're in tunnels fighting monsters.

770
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:24,995
That's not in the current game, but the top-down view is still in there.

771
00:45:24,995 --> 00:45:25,695
It's just as simple.

772
00:45:25,695 --> 00:45:31,196
But basically, it has always been some kind of super big multiplayer experience, right?

773
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:38,058
Yeah, well it started out as a multiplayer shooter with giant monkey heads before the Kirby ball thing.

774
00:45:38,678 --> 00:45:43,080
And over time, I increased the number of players.

775
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,162
The first test was actually Austin, Texas

776
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:49,343
to some business hotel in China.

777
00:45:49,343 --> 00:45:51,144
My brother-in-law was in China.

778
00:45:51,144 --> 00:45:53,464
We did the first network test.

779
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:55,385
I built the network system from scratch.

780
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:57,386
I had a background in programming,

781
00:45:57,386 --> 00:45:59,427
in a network program in particular.

782
00:45:59,427 --> 00:46:03,188
So I was like, oh, nobody's doing an indie multiplayer game.

783
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:05,131
Let me do an indie multiplayer game.

784
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:09,031
The reason nobody knows indie multiplayer is because they all fail.

785
00:46:09,031 --> 00:46:12,112
So there's this curse of the multiplayer game.

786
00:46:12,112 --> 00:46:15,992
But over time, I slowly, like, you know, I'm a performance junkie,

787
00:46:15,992 --> 00:46:16,653
so I kept working on it.

788
00:46:16,653 --> 00:46:19,493
Let's make it more scalable, we'll make it more scalable.

789
00:46:19,493 --> 00:46:21,373
I didn't have 700 people to play with,

790
00:46:21,373 --> 00:46:23,054
so I rented a bunch of machines to do that test.

791
00:46:23,054 --> 00:46:24,574
But I did get a small group of people,

792
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:28,955
including one of my, a guy from New Zealand who was into PlanetSide 1,

793
00:46:28,955 --> 00:46:31,035
and he didn't like PlanetSide 2,

794
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:33,135
so he's going to play this game instead of PlanetSide 2.

795
00:46:33,728 --> 00:46:43,135
And I had a lady from MMO Massively OP who really liked it, who was the one who wrote the article.

796
00:46:43,135 --> 00:46:44,676
I need to talk to her again.

797
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,318
And I will say one funny thing.

798
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:49,980
There was a...

799
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:50,920
It was a...

800
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,364
I got a comment from some guy on Twitter that had like hundreds of thousands of followers.

801
00:46:56,364 --> 00:46:58,226
I think he did the music for Minecraft.

802
00:46:58,226 --> 00:47:00,808
And it was him and his friends just making fun of the game saying,

803
00:47:00,808 --> 00:47:01,128
Oh!

804
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:05,973
what's the point of so many players, what's the point of having a faction that can make...

805
00:47:05,973 --> 00:47:06,153
C147? 417?

806
00:47:06,153 --> 00:47:09,515
I shouldn't say that, but we ended up making friends.

807
00:47:09,515 --> 00:47:17,799
But yeah, it had some highs and some lows, but at the end of the day I was glad I got it out of my shell

808
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:23,723
and put the game out there, even though the reception may not have been what I expected,

809
00:47:23,723 --> 00:47:26,044
but I really did know what I was doing.

810
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:28,485
But I got those players to play, and while it was not a lot of them,

811
00:47:28,485 --> 00:47:30,767
they were very dedicated, they watched the stream.

812
00:47:32,643 --> 00:47:35,965
They joined a community and they played for years.

813
00:47:35,965 --> 00:47:39,787
One of them is still a moderator in the current community.

814
00:47:39,787 --> 00:47:43,289
And they got me to see things from a new perspective

815
00:47:43,289 --> 00:47:44,570
and really help motivate me.

816
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,612
Because again, I mainly stayed at home.

817
00:47:47,612 --> 00:47:50,554
The next thing that really changed for the community

818
00:47:50,554 --> 00:47:53,696
was when I discovered Discord.

819
00:47:53,696 --> 00:47:57,258
And I did try mailing lists, a lot of the traditional stuff,

820
00:47:57,258 --> 00:47:58,478
going to conventions.

821
00:48:02,731 --> 00:48:08,375
None of that stuff worked. Posting in forums, you know, I did try to reach out to people,

822
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:13,899
but it really didn't work in any scalable manner. So it was just a handful of us.

823
00:48:13,899 --> 00:48:17,582
And then when Discord came out, you know, creating Discord doesn't do anything,

824
00:48:17,582 --> 00:48:23,286
but what I did is I joined all the Discord servers I could find that had something to do with gaming,

825
00:48:23,286 --> 00:48:26,088
and they would have looking for game groups, and I would say,

826
00:48:26,088 --> 00:48:27,669
Hey, anybody want to play HunterNet?

827
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:31,834
It means legitimate thing, and they say, what the heck is that?

828
00:48:31,834 --> 00:48:34,357
And I say, well, yes, this game, check it out.

829
00:48:34,357 --> 00:48:37,300
And eventually I say, it's my game, you want to play?

830
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:41,365
And then, so I slowly collected people that way.

831
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:45,569
And within a few weeks, the community

832
00:48:45,569 --> 00:48:46,971
tripled in size from seven to.

833
00:48:51,035 --> 00:48:52,937
But it grew, and we got our first,

834
00:48:52,937 --> 00:48:54,759
and we got some really, and people were really interested,

835
00:48:54,759 --> 00:48:56,120
and they're really passionate.

836
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:00,283
We had our first five moderators from those early days,

837
00:49:00,283 --> 00:49:01,904
and they're still with me.

838
00:49:01,904 --> 00:49:04,507
Then the other really big kick

839
00:49:04,507 --> 00:49:06,448
that really helped grow the community is HIO.

840
00:49:06,448 --> 00:49:10,071
When I was in Austin, I did go to the,

841
00:49:10,071 --> 00:49:14,715
Austin has a great indie development community.

842
00:49:14,715 --> 00:49:18,538
It's just bigger, and I think it's more intimidating maybe.

843
00:49:19,558 --> 00:49:26,242
Adam Saltzman, really famous guy in the indie game community, he did a talk when he was

844
00:49:26,242 --> 00:49:30,645
working on Overland, and he talked about how he was going to do HIO, and he was one of

845
00:49:30,645 --> 00:49:31,706
the first games on HIO.

846
00:49:31,706 --> 00:49:36,148
HIO did like an early access kind of thing, like first access I think they called it.

847
00:49:36,148 --> 00:49:36,869
Yeah, first access.

848
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:43,373
And he was really promoting that, and he had seen the crazy trailer, so he knew about my

849
00:49:43,373 --> 00:49:43,573
game.

850
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:52,093
That was one good thing about the game being crazy is that people who saw it would tend to remember you if you talked to them later.

851
00:49:52,093 --> 00:49:56,817
Actually, we had Adam talking about Overland here. He was on the screen.

852
00:49:56,817 --> 00:49:56,997
Yeah.

853
00:49:56,997 --> 00:50:06,245
Since moving from Austin, but he was one of the pinnacles of like, one of the cores of the community to help organize things and things.

854
00:50:06,245 --> 00:50:09,327
But he gave a talk about HIO and how awesome it was.

855
00:50:10,231 --> 00:50:12,172
So that was a huge help, just knowing about it.

856
00:50:12,172 --> 00:50:17,536
Because who knows how much later I would have found out about it.

857
00:50:17,536 --> 00:50:19,757
Once I got the game on itch.io, then it's free.

858
00:50:19,757 --> 00:50:23,780
And I wasn't ready to go, especially after that.

859
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,682
And that was with that experience with people being,

860
00:50:26,682 --> 00:50:27,602
what the heck is this?

861
00:50:27,602 --> 00:50:29,944
I didn't want to go on Steam and get, you know,

862
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:32,245
it's intimidating to go on Steam, right?

863
00:50:32,245 --> 00:50:34,006
People can be a little bit harsh.

864
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,722
So HIO just sounded perfect.

865
00:50:36,722 --> 00:50:37,803
I put the game on HIO.

866
00:50:37,803 --> 00:50:40,545
Before putting it on HIO, I changed the style to sci-fi,

867
00:50:40,545 --> 00:50:42,366
spacious kind of thing.

868
00:50:42,366 --> 00:50:44,088
And I changed the gameplay a bit, too.

869
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:46,149
It was moving in that direction.

870
00:50:46,149 --> 00:50:49,992
It sort of gradually morphed into a space game.

871
00:50:49,992 --> 00:50:56,077
And in HIO, it's been downloaded 16,000 times now.

872
00:50:56,077 --> 00:50:59,440
And every week, I haven't really advertised it because I

873
00:50:59,877 --> 00:51:02,501
I'm kind of happy with the slow, steady growth.

874
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:07,388
I don't want to be overwhelmed by managing more people than I have to before I'm ready.

875
00:51:07,388 --> 00:51:10,052
But, you know, I have Discord all over the game.

876
00:51:10,052 --> 00:51:12,836
Like, there's a voice bot in the game that says,

877
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:15,199
Please join Discord and talk to my creator!

878
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:19,375
When you fly in, there's big Star Wars style letters.

879
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:20,616
Come join us on Discord!

880
00:51:20,616 --> 00:51:25,038
When you go to the command screen, there's Discord everywhere.

881
00:51:25,038 --> 00:51:32,822
So I funnel everything through the Discord, and we get people donating Discord little by little.

882
00:51:32,822 --> 00:51:40,226
And we use Discord, we have a bot, we have multiple bots, one of our moderators is working on the bot.

883
00:51:40,226 --> 00:51:43,208
It advertises the streams, and it's been...

884
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:45,289
Without Discord and HIO, it would have been a lot harder.

885
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:49,914
Now I get plenty of feedback, and I have testers,

886
00:51:49,914 --> 00:51:51,915
and I feel it's been good.

887
00:51:51,915 --> 00:51:55,956
I actually have a few more things

888
00:51:55,956 --> 00:51:57,676
to say about early Discord.

889
00:51:57,676 --> 00:52:01,478
So really quickly, so Discord, I just

890
00:52:01,478 --> 00:52:05,479
triggered some memories right now.

891
00:52:05,479 --> 00:52:07,679
Two quick things.

892
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:11,260
Content creators, you have Twitch and YouTube

893
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,021
are the main ones right now.

894
00:52:13,523 --> 00:52:20,727
I think that we got successful because of Twitch players and YouTubers early in the day, but Twitch more than ever.

895
00:52:20,727 --> 00:52:28,252
And so these streamers, content creators, you want to pull them into your Discord, you want to spoil them too.

896
00:52:28,252 --> 00:52:34,375
You can give them some free keys, it shouldn't cost you anything, and give them more than once.

897
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:37,777
So maybe one for them, one for their friends, one to give away.

898
00:52:37,777 --> 00:52:39,418
And that has been a really big thing as well.

899
00:52:39,418 --> 00:52:41,519
And you invite them to your Discord and...

900
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:44,903
you give them a special role.

901
00:52:44,903 --> 00:52:46,784
And you want to make them feel special.

902
00:52:46,784 --> 00:52:48,384
Because they are special.

903
00:52:48,384 --> 00:52:49,625
They're promoting your game.

904
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:52,506
It's a nice win-win situation going on.

905
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:56,147
You actually have like 30 content creators online right

906
00:52:56,147 --> 00:52:57,207
now.

907
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:01,408
Yeah, we have over 100, maybe around almost exactly 100

908
00:53:01,408 --> 00:53:04,429
known content creators in our Discord.

909
00:53:04,429 --> 00:53:07,110
And so we'll have a Discord content creator chat

910
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:08,150
as well where we can.

911
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:09,947
We can talk to them directly.

912
00:53:09,947 --> 00:53:11,648
We can ping them all at the same time

913
00:53:11,648 --> 00:53:14,710
and say, hey, we have this special promotion going on.

914
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:17,851
They can collaborate with each other.

915
00:53:17,851 --> 00:53:20,613
Sometimes they'll have group ones

916
00:53:20,613 --> 00:53:22,954
where they'll voice chat with each other.

917
00:53:22,954 --> 00:53:26,636
So that really helps exposure, especially really early.

918
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:30,118
And then the second thing that really helped us early

919
00:53:30,118 --> 00:53:31,799
to get people is Reddit.

920
00:53:31,799 --> 00:53:34,060
And Reddit, it's a very unique crowd.

921
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:37,542
It'll take years to actually know how to talk.

922
00:53:37,912 --> 00:53:41,453
properly to Redditors, with the Redd- Redd-Kit, is what they call it.

923
00:53:41,453 --> 00:53:43,393
And it's a- it's a very different way to talk to people.

924
00:53:43,393 --> 00:53:45,954
You can't just go out there and be like, say,

925
00:53:45,954 --> 00:53:48,395
hey, look at my game, it's awesome.

926
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:51,515
No, it is- everyone will just, you know, download it,

927
00:53:51,515 --> 00:53:54,276
you'll get negative karma, everyone will hate you,

928
00:53:54,276 --> 00:53:56,477
and a lot of people will hate you, folks.

929
00:53:56,477 --> 00:53:59,018
But, um, once you get used to Reddit, it's a wonderful place.

930
00:53:59,018 --> 00:54:02,519
These are, like, real humans, and

931
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:04,059
the- what's cool about this is, um-

932
00:54:04,767 --> 00:54:09,909
Early, we had a free key giveaway called Veteran Status.

933
00:54:09,909 --> 00:54:14,370
So just before we launched, for one week, maybe it was two

934
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:19,631
weeks, we had a big, I think we used Glean.io to give away

935
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,692
our keys.

936
00:54:20,692 --> 00:54:23,692
And we just gave away tons and tons of keys for this

937
00:54:23,692 --> 00:54:24,933
duration.

938
00:54:24,933 --> 00:54:28,934
And so if you post it in the right places, you can Google

939
00:54:28,934 --> 00:54:31,955
giveaway sections, giveaway subreddits.

940
00:54:31,955 --> 00:54:34,015
And there's maybe about five or six that are.

941
00:54:34,568 --> 00:54:35,489
pretty legit.

942
00:54:35,489 --> 00:54:37,530
There are bots watching it.

943
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:41,652
And so if you get pretty popular in a post,

944
00:54:41,652 --> 00:54:42,753
a bot will pick it up.

945
00:54:42,753 --> 00:54:45,695
And do you guys use IFTTT?

946
00:54:45,695 --> 00:54:50,557
There are IFTTT bots that are watching these subreddits

947
00:54:50,557 --> 00:54:54,920
that will email your post to maybe 20, 30,000 people.

948
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:59,883
And so all these people will get delivered the key.

949
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:03,405
We had our huge first burst in Discord.

950
00:55:04,399 --> 00:55:06,501
by an IFTTT bot triggering.

951
00:55:06,501 --> 00:55:07,903
And I didn't even know about it.

952
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:10,145
I was signed up to get email alerts from this bot.

953
00:55:10,145 --> 00:55:11,286
That's how I knew.

954
00:55:11,286 --> 00:55:12,127
And I got an alert.

955
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,649
I'm like, oh, wait a second, I got an alert.

956
00:55:14,649 --> 00:55:16,371
And you can go to ifttt.com,

957
00:55:16,371 --> 00:55:18,873
and if you look at the recipes,

958
00:55:18,873 --> 00:55:24,338
you can see how many people are subscribed to these recipes.

959
00:55:24,338 --> 00:55:27,461
And so the Reddit one for free key, it's very popular.

960
00:55:27,461 --> 00:55:28,903
I get free keys all the time.

961
00:55:29,385 --> 00:55:32,648
I think back then there were 18,000 people following it.

962
00:55:32,648 --> 00:55:35,510
And so now there's probably, you know,

963
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:37,732
it might be even like 80,000, 100,000,

964
00:55:37,732 --> 00:55:42,437
just for posting your free key giveaway.

965
00:55:42,437 --> 00:55:45,720
So that really helped us in the early days.

966
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,022
Steam giveaways.

967
00:55:48,022 --> 00:55:51,906
Steam giveaways.

968
00:55:51,906 --> 00:55:56,210
Not all of these are the best ones though.

969
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:03,472
It's been a while since I used it.

970
00:56:03,472 --> 00:56:06,974
My favorite Reddit is reddit.com slash r slash game dev.

971
00:56:06,974 --> 00:56:10,536
And they post all the time.

972
00:56:10,536 --> 00:56:12,517
The game dev was pretty obvious.

973
00:56:12,517 --> 00:56:14,358
Yeah, this one's pretty obvious.

974
00:56:14,358 --> 00:56:18,681
But if you forget the list of legit ones to give away, just

975
00:56:18,681 --> 00:56:20,262
Oh, they have a list here, right?

976
00:56:20,262 --> 00:56:22,303
I am almost positive I saw a list here

977
00:56:22,303 --> 00:56:23,604
of the best giveaway ones.

978
00:56:23,604 --> 00:56:25,585
They have a really useful sidebar.

979
00:56:25,585 --> 00:56:26,785
Yeah, maybe it's somewhere here.

980
00:56:26,785 --> 00:56:27,626
FAQs somewhere.

981
00:56:30,624 --> 00:56:39,608
You'll find it. If you search for it, you'll spend no longer than five minutes, you'll find it.

982
00:56:39,608 --> 00:56:51,192
So I guess, actually I also want to talk to Ed about this because

983
00:56:51,192 --> 00:56:55,674
I was speaking in Android 4.0 a bit for a moment.

984
00:56:56,202 --> 00:57:01,983
所以因為他們三個遊戲剛好都是多了連線或是有Early Access

985
00:57:01,983 --> 00:57:05,224
所以其實這樣子的遊戲的...

986
00:57:05,224 --> 00:57:12,025
算是推廣方式跟單人單機或是說那種有劇情主線的遊戲其實

987
00:57:12,025 --> 00:57:14,125
推廣方式會很不一樣

988
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:17,566
那我現在...因為剛好我們最後一位

989
00:57:17,566 --> 00:57:19,366
就是剛進來的...就是最後進來的這位講者

990
00:57:19,366 --> 00:57:24,047
他做的遊戲我們剛好看到是一個JRPG

991
00:57:26,385 --> 00:57:27,926
是一個Cyberpunk JRPG

992
00:57:27,926 --> 00:57:29,386
那他就不是多人

993
00:57:29,386 --> 00:57:31,847
他可能也沒有Early Access

994
00:57:31,847 --> 00:57:33,508
那這樣的情況下就是

995
00:57:33,508 --> 00:57:34,028
狀況很不一樣

996
00:57:34,028 --> 00:57:37,009
我想請教說他的想法是什麼

997
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:51,708
your game is different from early access games or multiplayer games?

998
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:53,610
Yeah, it's not multiplayer, it's very story-driven.

999
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:56,852
So, I know you mentioned this recently, right?

1000
00:57:56,852 --> 00:58:03,376
Don't worry about it's story-driven, just get it out there, get people playing it,

1001
00:58:03,376 --> 00:58:09,020
and then you can work on those people's feedback about the story and stuff,

1002
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,862
and then improve it and make it better.

1003
00:58:11,862 --> 00:58:14,463
But there's also like the fear of...

1004
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:28,994
Oh, if I put it out and those people play it, and then you update it, they're not going to go back and play what they've already played over again.

1005
00:58:28,994 --> 00:58:36,556
I think it's a fear that I need to get over and just put whatever I have out and not worry.

1006
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:55,568
if your goal is to make the best possible game you can make, then the easiest way to

1007
00:58:55,568 --> 00:59:08,251
get there is to get feedback from real people. And just because you give away the game for

1008
00:59:08,251 --> 00:59:15,973
free or just because you spoil it for some users, does not shrink your market.

1009
00:59:16,263 --> 00:59:18,645
because the market is infinite.

1010
00:59:18,645 --> 00:59:23,688
There are how many hundred million people on Steam who buy games?

1011
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:27,891
We as indies will never hit that 100 million cap.

1012
00:59:27,891 --> 00:59:31,333
Our game is pretty big for indie and we hit 3 million.

1013
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:36,057
And I guarantee you there's another 3 million people out there

1014
00:59:36,057 --> 00:59:39,139
who would buy the game if they only heard about it.

1015
00:59:40,103 --> 00:59:44,866
No one's heard about your game, right? That's the number one problem.

1016
00:59:44,866 --> 00:59:49,810
And the other problem is, are you working on the right stuff?

1017
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:55,473
So I truly believe that you just get more value out of putting it out there,

1018
00:59:55,473 --> 01:00:00,457
being open and collecting the feedback and then working on that feedback,

1019
01:00:00,457 --> 01:00:04,860
than you lose by spoiling it to some people,

1020
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:08,322
or because those people will now not buy your game, right?

1021
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:11,700
How many keys did you give away?

1022
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,180
We gave away...

1023
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,701
probably

1024
01:00:13,701 --> 01:00:18,822
probably about one third of

1025
01:00:18,822 --> 01:00:21,883
the activations are probably all giveaways and

1026
01:00:21,883 --> 01:00:23,243
you know everything

1027
01:00:23,243 --> 01:00:27,164
every time you give away a key... So it's more than ten thousand, I guess?

1028
01:00:27,164 --> 01:00:31,325
Yeah, it's more than ten thousand keys that we've given away in total

1029
01:00:31,325 --> 01:00:33,645
and especially as an online game

1030
01:00:33,968 --> 01:00:36,569
you know, you want people to play with their friends.

1031
01:00:36,569 --> 01:00:38,669
So when you give away a key to one person,

1032
01:00:38,669 --> 01:00:40,930
and then they'll drag their friend in,

1033
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:42,330
and they'll drag their friend in.

1034
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:44,251
It's just a pyramid.

1035
01:00:44,251 --> 01:00:49,473
So there, just like he said, there's an infinite pool of people.

1036
01:00:49,473 --> 01:00:51,353
And I mean, that's a multiplayer game,

1037
01:00:51,353 --> 01:00:54,294
you have a single player game,

1038
01:00:54,294 --> 01:00:54,894
but that sells.

1039
01:00:54,894 --> 01:00:56,275
They were here at TGF.

1040
01:00:56,275 --> 01:00:57,415
That's a single player game.

1041
01:00:57,415 --> 01:00:58,896
They gave away 10,000 keys as well, right?

1042
01:00:58,896 --> 01:01:01,557
And they sold 1 million additional copies.

1043
01:01:02,264 --> 01:01:06,565
It's not like you give away a key for free and then you lose.

1044
01:01:06,565 --> 01:01:07,745
You print free money.

1045
01:01:07,745 --> 01:01:14,947
If you give the keys to the right people who have an audience,

1046
01:01:14,947 --> 01:01:24,409
like the content creators, then it just slows down.

1047
01:01:24,409 --> 01:01:26,889
Elsa has something to say.

1048
01:01:26,889 --> 01:01:31,810
This is my wife Elsa, the co-founder of Throne of Lies.

1049
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:37,838
So we did a giveaway, really really big giveaway last December.

1050
01:01:38,292 --> 01:01:40,934
and we're working with content creator YoggCast.

1051
01:01:40,934 --> 01:01:42,855
Can you speak Chinese?

1052
01:01:42,855 --> 01:01:45,496
Yeah, but I want to respect them too.

1053
01:01:45,496 --> 01:01:47,817
We give away a lot.

1054
01:01:47,817 --> 01:01:53,120
We were even thinking about, damn, should we give that much?

1055
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,442
Because they asked for so much.

1056
01:01:55,442 --> 01:02:01,105
But in the end, we decided to give away that much to YoggCast.

1057
01:02:01,105 --> 01:02:03,246
And it actually brings a lot from Africa.

1058
01:02:03,246 --> 01:02:03,986
YoggCast is the YouTuber YoggCast.

1059
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:04,627
These people, right?

1060
01:02:04,627 --> 01:02:04,747
Yeah.

1061
01:02:04,747 --> 01:02:05,567
Yeah, these people.

1062
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:05,767
Yeah.

1063
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:06,087
Yeah.

1064
01:02:06,087 --> 01:02:06,207
Yeah.

1065
01:02:06,207 --> 01:02:06,808
Yeah.

1066
01:02:06,808 --> 01:02:06,968
Yeah.

1067
01:02:06,968 --> 01:02:07,048
Yeah.

1068
01:02:07,048 --> 01:02:07,228
Yeah.

1069
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:07,328
Yeah.

1070
01:02:07,328 --> 01:02:07,508
Yeah.

1071
01:02:07,508 --> 01:02:08,108
These people, yeah.

1072
01:02:16,629 --> 01:02:22,013
We... I'm not sure if I'm... I don't think I can say the exact number, but it was more than 10,000 keys.

1073
01:02:22,013 --> 01:02:23,874
Just for the event?

1074
01:02:23,874 --> 01:02:26,716
Just for the event, yeah. It was tens of thousands of keys.

1075
01:02:26,716 --> 01:02:31,440
But just because we give those away doesn't mean they're all going to use it.

1076
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,323
And a lot of them will activate it and they'll just let it rot.

1077
01:02:36,323 --> 01:02:40,826
I know I haven't played half of my library, but eventually they will.

1078
01:02:40,826 --> 01:02:46,370
And the thing is, every time they see your game, it puts a seed in the back of their mind.

1079
01:02:46,716 --> 01:02:55,320
It's just like, you know, when you see Coca-Cola ads, why do they spend so much money so that you can see it for one second?

1080
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:02,864
It's because eventually you'll think about it, and if you see little hints and pieces of it, it'll remind you.

1081
01:03:02,864 --> 01:03:05,185
It's just, everything's psychology.

1082
01:03:05,185 --> 01:03:05,305
Mm-hmm.

1083
01:03:05,305 --> 01:03:05,765
Okay.

1084
01:03:05,765 --> 01:03:06,766
Sorry, I wasn't ready.

1085
01:03:06,766 --> 01:03:07,046
Like that!

1086
01:03:07,046 --> 01:03:07,506
Advice taken.

1087
01:03:07,506 --> 01:03:11,468
Give me a couple of weeks to fix things up and I'll...

1088
01:03:18,149 --> 01:03:24,233
I think you do want to avoid giving these things to press, right?

1089
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:32,738
Yeah, I think part of my worry is giving it to press early and also I'm still looking for funding

1090
01:03:32,738 --> 01:03:45,646
and I don't know if putting it out in early access, as it were, is going to affect any future relationships with publishers or...

1091
01:03:46,202 --> 01:03:50,806
money people, they're like, oh well, you know, just put it out and it's not... I don't know,

1092
01:03:50,806 --> 01:03:57,392
if it... maybe people don't like it and they're like, oh well. I don't know, they're like,

1093
01:03:57,392 --> 01:04:02,016
you know, if that's not part of their plan of putting it out in early access, then, I

1094
01:04:02,016 --> 01:04:04,218
don't know. Maybe that's the basic...

1095
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:18,360
Um...

1096
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,102
I don't have money. I do not.

1097
01:04:21,102 --> 01:04:23,283
Laughter

1098
01:04:23,283 --> 01:04:24,424
We're all...

1099
01:04:24,424 --> 01:04:26,246
Laughter

1100
01:04:26,246 --> 01:04:29,248
We're all looking for money, right?

1101
01:04:29,248 --> 01:04:30,729
Laughter

1102
01:04:30,729 --> 01:04:31,150
I, I, I have...

1103
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:32,411
There's a point.

1104
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:33,331
So my minimum...

1105
01:04:33,331 --> 01:04:38,475
I'm not sure if it would be in NT

1106
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:41,037
but...

1107
01:04:41,037 --> 01:04:41,378
like 160,000

1108
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:43,119
pounds.

1109
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,481
Okay.

1110
01:04:45,972 --> 01:04:47,772
So let's say 200,000 US dollars.

1111
01:04:47,772 --> 01:04:48,212
Yeah.

1112
01:04:48,212 --> 01:04:55,134
How much money do you burn each month?

1113
01:04:55,134 --> 01:05:02,076
Not like one package, because 200,000, that is what you calculate you need to finish the game, right?

1114
01:05:02,076 --> 01:05:02,136
Yes.

1115
01:05:02,136 --> 01:05:04,417
So, ok, forget about that calculation.

1116
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:09,998
Give me the number of money you need every month to keep going.

1117
01:05:09,998 --> 01:05:10,938
How much would that be?

1118
01:05:13,793 --> 01:05:14,974
I don't understand the difference.

1119
01:05:14,974 --> 01:05:16,655
Like, there is no difference.

1120
01:05:16,655 --> 01:05:20,197
I just want to go, like, the 200,000 lasted for how many years?

1121
01:05:20,197 --> 01:05:21,978
Uh, that's like 18 months.

1122
01:05:21,978 --> 01:05:28,761
So that's me and freelance artists and blah blah blah.

1123
01:05:28,761 --> 01:05:31,222
So here's the point.

1124
01:05:31,222 --> 01:05:32,623
I mean, I can continue working on this.

1125
01:05:34,755 --> 01:05:37,777
So you don't necessarily need the money?

1126
01:05:37,777 --> 01:05:44,882
At some point I will need the money to pay the contractors for the art that I cannot do myself.

1127
01:05:44,882 --> 01:05:52,888
The point I'm trying to make is that you can absolutely sell an unfinished game, right?

1128
01:05:52,888 --> 01:05:54,409
And a few people will buy it.

1129
01:05:54,409 --> 01:06:03,575
You will not get 200,000 from launching it on Early Access, but you will get some amount of money.

1130
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:11,368
And if the game is any good and you keep working on it and you keep iterating on the feedback,

1131
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:17,231
at least that's my opinion, there is a fair chance that next month more people will buy

1132
01:06:17,231 --> 01:06:21,532
it than the previous month.

1133
01:06:21,532 --> 01:06:26,114
And so whatever your money is that you're looking for every month, your burndown money

1134
01:06:26,114 --> 01:06:32,617
basically, there is a good chance that on Early Access you can hit that amount of money.

1135
01:06:33,436 --> 01:06:36,397
And then you can develop the game forever.

1136
01:06:36,397 --> 01:06:38,838
That was what happened to us.

1137
01:06:38,838 --> 01:06:43,019
When we launched Early Access, we were below that threshold.

1138
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:45,580
But then once the streamers picked it up,

1139
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,580
and it became more and more known,

1140
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:52,001
and they took it and carried it out into the world,

1141
01:06:52,001 --> 01:06:55,402
more people, enough people were buying the game every month

1142
01:06:55,402 --> 01:06:59,904
that money was coming in, that enough money was coming in

1143
01:06:59,904 --> 01:07:03,045
so that we could just continue paying our developers.

1144
01:07:04,179 --> 01:07:07,621
As long as that money is coming in every month, we could go forever.

1145
01:07:07,621 --> 01:07:17,027
That is the alternative business model that I'm proposing, in a way.

1146
01:07:17,027 --> 01:07:20,289
Because if you do that, you don't need a publisher.

1147
01:07:20,289 --> 01:07:25,453
You don't have to give away your IP, you don't have to give away your revenue.

1148
01:07:25,453 --> 01:07:28,815
You're truly indie if you do that.

1149
01:07:28,815 --> 01:07:33,698
It's truly scary, so I would like to hear your opinion on that.

1150
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:38,837
I agree with you mostly, I think if you have a bit of a wrong way to begin with.

1151
01:07:38,837 --> 01:07:47,541
I think in my situation that seems hard to me because to create more content and keep

1152
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:56,745
the interest and to get those early access sales, I need to pay people to do art and

1153
01:07:56,745 --> 01:07:58,966
things to make new stuff for people to play.

1154
01:07:58,966 --> 01:08:00,086
I do not have the money.

1155
01:08:00,939 --> 01:08:08,262
to pay those people and it's very unlikely that I would be able to generate enough money

1156
01:08:08,262 --> 01:08:11,523
from sales to do that.

1157
01:08:11,523 --> 01:08:16,065
Right, so you're saying the 200,000 that you want, you would actually not spend them on

1158
01:08:16,065 --> 01:08:23,307
yourself but you would hire people for that money to help you finish the job?

1159
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:25,588
I mean, a large chunk of that, yes.

1160
01:08:25,588 --> 01:08:25,968
I see.

1161
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:28,889
So if I had like, say...

1162
01:08:32,388 --> 01:08:34,229
I don't know, 10, 20,000.

1163
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:38,292
That would give me enough of a run up to generate,

1164
01:08:38,292 --> 01:08:43,496
or start generating content that I could then

1165
01:08:43,496 --> 01:08:46,438
be updating the game with.

1166
01:08:46,438 --> 01:08:49,100
As I go, there's like a little initial hump

1167
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:52,042
that I need to get over to them.

1168
01:08:52,042 --> 01:08:53,664
Does that make sense?

1169
01:08:53,664 --> 01:08:55,185
Yes, a lot of it makes sense.

1170
01:08:55,185 --> 01:09:00,929
I think everyone in this room knows about initial humps.

1171
01:09:01,396 --> 01:09:04,317
I may have a solution to your problem.

1172
01:09:04,317 --> 01:09:04,477
Oop!

1173
01:09:04,477 --> 01:09:04,677
Shuffle.

1174
01:09:04,677 --> 01:09:06,518
This is getting exciting.

1175
01:09:06,518 --> 01:09:07,058
Okay, so...

1176
01:09:07,058 --> 01:09:09,339
We were just thinking about the shuffle.

1177
01:09:09,339 --> 01:09:11,040
Are you rich?

1178
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:11,660
I'm not rich.

1179
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:13,661
Sorry, sorry again, once more.

1180
01:09:13,661 --> 01:09:18,463
However, what you can do is profit share.

1181
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:25,025
And it's not the most popular thing, but we did profit share.

1182
01:09:25,025 --> 01:09:28,367
Our current artist is profit share.

1183
01:09:28,852 --> 01:09:33,115
and uh... you know we we started off with a decent amount of profit share

1184
01:09:33,115 --> 01:09:38,179
and that really helped us. You have to find someone that's uh...

1185
01:09:38,179 --> 01:09:42,222
very dedicated and passionate about your project

1186
01:09:42,222 --> 01:09:44,284
I want to pay people

1187
01:09:44,284 --> 01:09:49,388
like not not not, that sounds very rude actually, I'm sorry

1188
01:09:49,388 --> 01:09:49,628
uh... yeah

1189
01:09:49,628 --> 01:09:50,669
I personally think

1190
01:09:50,669 --> 01:09:53,572
profit share fine but you need to pay them a base wage

1191
01:09:53,572 --> 01:09:57,255
beforehand. I'm not going to ask someone to work for free on my game

1192
01:09:57,775 --> 01:10:01,278
with the chance that there's no money at the end of it.

1193
01:10:01,278 --> 01:10:07,062
But the thing is, you're also working on this game with the chance there's no money at the end of it.

1194
01:10:07,062 --> 01:10:13,967
Yeah, but that's fine. I've got contract work that I can pay my own bills with.

1195
01:10:13,967 --> 01:10:20,171
I guess the biggest difference is that if you're going to contractors,

1196
01:10:20,171 --> 01:10:24,434
then most of the contractors basically expect to be paid up front.

1197
01:10:24,434 --> 01:10:25,395
I think this is a norm, right?

1198
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:29,782
It's a different kind of contract. It's a contractor.

1199
01:10:29,782 --> 01:10:35,965
But I mean, if you met people who are actually really very enthusiastic about your project,

1200
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:43,589
and they're actually willing to jump onto the ship with the idea that I may not get any money out of it,

1201
01:10:43,589 --> 01:10:48,812
or maybe very less, instead of getting paid up front.

1202
01:10:49,902 --> 01:10:59,607
then basically, I wouldn't officially say these guys are contractors.

1203
01:10:59,607 --> 01:11:01,928
Basically, they are on your ship.

1204
01:11:01,928 --> 01:11:02,429
And so...

1205
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:05,310
They're basically partners.

1206
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:07,011
Yeah, they're basically partners.

1207
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:10,793
There is another game that actually did something like this.

1208
01:11:10,793 --> 01:11:11,113
Armello.

1209
01:11:11,113 --> 01:11:12,954
Oh, this guy's great.

1210
01:11:12,954 --> 01:11:15,315
So Armello actually have a formal...

1211
01:11:15,315 --> 01:11:18,657
So Armello actually have a...

1212
01:11:20,064 --> 01:11:23,187
正式的祭典方式

1213
01:11:23,187 --> 01:11:24,428
就是說

1214
01:11:24,428 --> 01:11:25,829
他把很多contract找來

1215
01:11:25,829 --> 01:11:28,311
然後他就把他用正式的祭典方式說

1216
01:11:28,311 --> 01:11:30,873
我做這件工作是多少點

1217
01:11:30,873 --> 01:11:32,394
我做這件工作多少點

1218
01:11:32,394 --> 01:11:34,936
然後他們到最後可以

1219
01:11:34,936 --> 01:11:37,998
就是用這個公平的點數計算方式

1220
01:11:37,998 --> 01:11:38,839
去最後來分錢

1221
01:11:38,839 --> 01:11:41,521
來分他們的revenue

1222
01:11:41,521 --> 01:11:42,302
那

1223
01:11:42,302 --> 01:11:43,402
可是我其實是有問過這個

1224
01:11:43,402 --> 01:11:44,263
因為他們其實有來過台灣呃

1225
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:48,220
應該不只一次

1226
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,122
然後我也在其他場合遇過他們

1227
01:11:50,122 --> 01:11:51,823
那他們的講法是說

1228
01:11:51,823 --> 01:11:54,485
因為他們的遊戲基本上其實是撥Game

1229
01:11:54,485 --> 01:11:55,846
撥Game然後數位化

1230
01:11:55,846 --> 01:11:58,368
那其實他們絕大部分的像遊戲規則

1231
01:11:58,368 --> 01:12:00,389
之類的東西

1232
01:12:00,389 --> 01:12:04,012
其實在紙上已經實驗完了

1233
01:12:04,012 --> 01:12:05,093
然後他才說

1234
01:12:05,093 --> 01:12:07,014
喔我之後要數位化

1235
01:12:07,014 --> 01:12:09,175
所以我需要多少人去畫

1236
01:12:09,175 --> 01:12:10,837
什麼100張卡牌

1237
01:12:10,837 --> 01:12:13,419
我要多少人去產生地圖

1238
01:12:13,419 --> 01:12:14,760
所以

1239
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:14,780
他

1240
01:12:16,508 --> 01:12:20,571
I remember I asked him, and he said that about 60-70% of the game content

1241
01:12:20,571 --> 01:12:24,735
was already done when he was doing the action of unboxing the package.

1242
01:12:24,735 --> 01:12:28,238
And there were very few changes afterwards.

1243
01:12:28,238 --> 01:12:34,043
So I think, my point is that there definitely are like...

1244
01:12:34,043 --> 01:12:38,246
sort of like successful stories from this kind of game that, you know,

1245
01:12:38,246 --> 01:12:41,449
they have a very good revenue share system.

1246
01:12:41,449 --> 01:12:45,112
That actually, you know, is...

1247
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:54,806
You can see the spreadsheet, how much is going to be paid to this person based on revenue share.

1248
01:12:54,806 --> 01:12:57,628
They have a very formal system of it.

1249
01:12:57,628 --> 01:13:00,770
But this is still the only case I've heard about.

1250
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:03,271
I mean, they also got a lot of money from Indie Bundle.

1251
01:13:03,271 --> 01:13:07,874
Yeah, that's true. But I don't know if that's up front or later.

1252
01:13:07,874 --> 01:13:09,075
That might be later.

1253
01:13:09,075 --> 01:13:13,858
I think it's later, because they started working with contractors before Indie Bundle.

1254
01:13:13,988 --> 01:13:23,720
I know their IndieFund announcement, but that's like only a very little time before they actually launch.

1255
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:34,453
I think asking people to essentially work for free with maybe the promise of profit share later is...

1256
01:13:47,725 --> 01:13:49,145
this is my project.

1257
01:13:49,145 --> 01:13:52,786
Like, it's hard, like, if I was starting something

1258
01:13:52,786 --> 01:13:56,687
and they had a chance to have a lot of input on it

1259
01:13:56,687 --> 01:13:59,387
from early on, then maybe it would be different.

1260
01:13:59,387 --> 01:14:02,048
But just asking someone to like,

1261
01:14:02,048 --> 01:14:04,769
oh hey, come do what I tell you on this thing,

1262
01:14:04,769 --> 01:14:07,109
like, is hard.

1263
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,150
And, like, I,

1264
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:14,891
having asked people to do stuff.

1265
01:14:16,722 --> 01:14:21,025
for free previously, it's like, well, they might do it,

1266
01:14:21,025 --> 01:14:23,907
you might have to poke them loads, and then you feel bad

1267
01:14:23,907 --> 01:14:25,448
because they're doing it for free.

1268
01:14:25,448 --> 01:14:28,770
And it's hard to get people's best work out of them

1269
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:30,992
or get them to dedicate the time I found it.

1270
01:14:30,992 --> 01:14:37,876
I wanted to say that this is sort of getting

1271
01:14:37,876 --> 01:14:39,497
to business strategy, right?

1272
01:14:39,497 --> 01:14:43,900
And I think something we really need to keep in mind is that

1273
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:48,768
Every game is different, and things have been changing very quickly in this.

1274
01:14:48,768 --> 01:14:54,289
I want to push back a little bit in the indie sphere.

1275
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:57,790
I think Early Access worked really well for Subnautica,

1276
01:14:57,790 --> 01:15:02,711
what you guys did with Game of Lives worked really well, but...

1277
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:06,472
On Discord, I'm in lots of groups of other developers

1278
01:15:06,472 --> 01:15:10,933
that have tried to do their multiplayer shooter on Early Access,

1279
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:16,917
their other thing, and you see that the advice that worked like a year ago, or even months

1280
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:19,119
ago doesn't necessarily work anymore.

1281
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:25,863
I think that it's good to look at what you should go out there and look at what other

1282
01:15:25,863 --> 01:15:31,207
people have done and what's successful to them, but you really have to be careful and

1283
01:15:31,207 --> 01:15:34,269
see how things have changed and how your project is different.

1284
01:15:34,269 --> 01:15:39,312
Different funding models are going to work better for different games, and I think with

1285
01:15:39,312 --> 01:15:39,813
Ed's game.

1286
01:15:40,143 --> 01:15:43,865
If he just put it on early access right now, I would definitely predict that

1287
01:15:43,865 --> 01:15:48,869
he's going to have the discoverability problem number one.

1288
01:15:48,869 --> 01:15:51,191
Nobody's going to even know that it's on early access.

1289
01:15:51,191 --> 01:15:58,316
The amount of money he's going to be able to generate is just not going to be enough to pay anything.

1290
01:15:58,316 --> 01:16:00,357
They say now, for a lot of gamers,

1291
01:16:00,357 --> 01:16:04,540
your early access launch is your launch. It can be really difficult

1292
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:08,283
to get, I'm not going to give any numbers, but I know a really

1293
01:16:08,283 --> 01:16:09,884
successful game that just...

1294
01:16:10,642 --> 01:16:15,965
came out at the end of 2018, and yeah, they thought they were going to get a big bump.

1295
01:16:15,965 --> 01:16:21,607
And they're a really well-known indie game, and they got a small fraction of the Steam

1296
01:16:21,607 --> 01:16:26,069
front page attention that they did not that long ago when they did their early access

1297
01:16:26,069 --> 01:16:26,309
launch.

1298
01:16:26,309 --> 01:16:27,430
And this is a big game.

1299
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:28,890
This is already...

1300
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:31,231
Going in as an indie is like doing a start.

1301
01:16:31,231 --> 01:16:35,093
You have to assume that one in ten, I don't know what numbers, are going to fail.

1302
01:16:35,093 --> 01:16:36,654
And that could be you.

1303
01:16:36,654 --> 01:16:40,515
If you only look at the successes and think, oh, by what they did, it's going to...

1304
01:16:52,925 --> 01:16:55,486
that's really important because if you do want to do sharing,

1305
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:59,588
you know, get an artist involved, they need to be compassionate about your work.

1306
01:16:59,588 --> 01:17:02,049
Nobody's going to be compassionate about it if they haven't seen it.

1307
01:17:02,049 --> 01:17:06,110
And what I would do, if I were you, is go on Discord and do similar to what I did.

1308
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:10,792
Go join communities having to do with Japanese stuff, and there are a lot of them.

1309
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:15,214
I got some of my players from, like, anime groups that had nothing to do with space games.

1310
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:17,875
And you can talk to them individually.

1311
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:19,656
Because you've got to start small.

1312
01:17:19,656 --> 01:17:21,977
When you're trying to scale, nobody's...

1313
01:17:22,253 --> 01:17:25,296
Go and talk to them and say, hey, you want to check out this game?

1314
01:17:25,296 --> 01:17:26,216
I can give you access to it.

1315
01:17:26,216 --> 01:17:27,237
You don't even have to be on HIO.

1316
01:17:27,237 --> 01:17:27,978
You can give them a direct link.

1317
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:31,720
And from those people, you're going to get feedback.

1318
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,622
And because you gave them personal attention,

1319
01:17:33,622 --> 01:17:37,565
they might say, hey, I can become your moderator,

1320
01:17:37,565 --> 01:17:40,147
or I can help talk to my friends that are really

1321
01:17:40,147 --> 01:17:41,548
into this style of game.

1322
01:17:41,548 --> 01:17:43,489
And it's not the same.

1323
01:17:43,489 --> 01:17:44,990
From those people, you might find people

1324
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:47,312
that could become partners and work with you.

1325
01:17:47,312 --> 01:17:49,253
And I think that's the way.

1326
01:17:53,606 --> 01:18:06,769
I think the main takeaway from this is that don't be afraid to actually give your game to people that you might not know beforehand.

1327
01:18:06,769 --> 01:18:13,031
I mean, showing your game is always good and it's easy to forget that.

1328
01:18:13,031 --> 01:18:18,712
Like taking it to events or like today.

1329
01:18:19,838 --> 01:18:22,700
我爸爸也有,如果你們想看看我玩的遊戲的話

1330
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:23,541
我爸爸有教過我

1331
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:23,561
我會...

1332
01:18:23,561 --> 01:18:23,801
我會...

1333
01:18:23,801 --> 01:18:24,122
我會... 解釋一下

1334
01:18:24,122 --> 01:18:30,627
我會... 解釋一下 從其他的印尼玩家來的知識

1335
01:18:30,627 --> 01:18:33,349
我會... 解釋一下 從其他的印尼玩家來的知識

1336
01:18:33,349 --> 01:18:38,653
我會... 解釋一下 從其他的印尼玩家來的知識

1337
01:18:38,653 --> 01:18:39,494
就是...

1338
01:18:39,494 --> 01:18:40,535
其實蠻久以前

1339
01:18:40,535 --> 01:18:42,216
就是有蠻多美國的印尼

1340
01:18:42,216 --> 01:18:43,878
有講過一個概念是說

1341
01:18:43,878 --> 01:18:44,939
就是...

1342
01:18:44,939 --> 01:18:45,979
你在Steam上

1343
01:18:45,979 --> 01:18:46,840
只需要賣給0%的玩家

1344
01:18:48,838 --> 01:18:50,799
你的遊戲就可以...應該說

1345
01:18:50,799 --> 01:18:56,162
就是你的遊戲只要賣給在Steam上0%的玩家

1346
01:18:56,162 --> 01:18:57,964
你的遊戲其實就有機會活得下來

1347
01:18:57,964 --> 01:18:59,685
那這個前提是因為

1348
01:18:59,685 --> 01:19:02,266
其實你獨立遊戲就算賣得再多

1349
01:19:02,266 --> 01:19:08,730
你的coverage通常也大概都是Steam user的0.幾%而已

1350
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:11,292
那這個數據的另外一個面向的意思是說

1351
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:15,394
一定有這麼多人還...他就是完全沒有聽過你的遊戲

1352
01:19:15,394 --> 01:19:15,595
所以...

1353
01:19:16,361 --> 01:19:20,403
沒有道理說 因為我怕我的遊戲給別人看

1354
01:19:20,403 --> 01:19:23,745
所以我就故意什麼都不講

1355
01:19:23,745 --> 01:19:28,227
或者是說我怕可能有人會抄我的idea

1356
01:19:28,227 --> 01:19:29,647
或者是說有人會覺得說我現在做得不好

1357
01:19:29,647 --> 01:19:30,968
他以後不想再跟我講話之類的

1358
01:19:30,968 --> 01:19:35,971
就是理論上這種概念應該是不太存在的

1359
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:37,991
就是你永遠有新的人可以去講

1360
01:19:37,991 --> 01:19:39,692
然後你永遠有新的人可以去認識

1361
01:19:41,633 --> 01:19:43,974
那在銷售上來說的話就是

1362
01:19:43,974 --> 01:19:46,575
其實你永遠有新的銷售對象

1363
01:19:46,575 --> 01:19:47,995
那只是問題是說

1364
01:19:47,995 --> 01:19:50,796
一開始的那個最早的那小撮人

1365
01:19:50,796 --> 01:19:52,096
你要怎麼去找到

1366
01:19:52,096 --> 01:19:54,557
那可能他們可以幫你去做宣傳

1367
01:19:54,557 --> 01:19:55,037
類似像這樣的事情

1368
01:19:55,037 --> 01:19:55,077
所以

1369
01:19:55,077 --> 01:19:59,178
Yeah, I guess that's what I'm trying to say

1370
01:19:59,178 --> 01:20:02,119
that, you know, like

1371
01:20:02,119 --> 01:20:06,200
the 0% analogy is that

1372
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,461
basically you can

1373
01:20:10,043 --> 01:20:14,724
just you can survive just by selling to 0% of the Steam user.

1374
01:20:14,724 --> 01:20:20,186
You can actually still survive because there are so many players there

1375
01:20:20,186 --> 01:20:24,207
and also it means that there are

1376
01:20:24,207 --> 01:20:26,467
almost 100% of the players that just

1377
01:20:26,467 --> 01:20:30,968
never heard about your game before so you should not be afraid of

1378
01:20:30,968 --> 01:20:34,569
you know like, oh my game is going to leak out there

1379
01:20:34,569 --> 01:20:37,050
and you know they will pirate it or

1380
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:38,230
copy my ID or things like that.

1381
01:20:41,351 --> 01:20:51,656
So, I guess that's actually a very long discussion about discoverability and survivability, I guess.

1382
01:20:51,656 --> 01:20:58,999
So, I guess I want to close down with, I want to just do a closing with a bit more casual question.

1383
01:20:58,999 --> 01:21:07,903
So, can you guys tell the audience that maybe just one game, you can say, I've been playing this game.

1384
01:21:08,623 --> 01:21:12,144
for maybe a couple of months in the past, or maybe

1385
01:21:12,144 --> 01:21:16,846
a few, one or two years in the past, and I think that game's good, you should check out the game

1386
01:21:16,846 --> 01:21:23,568
and why. Like just, name one game and say something about it.

1387
01:21:23,568 --> 01:21:25,369
I may take the game that

1388
01:21:25,369 --> 01:21:28,350
some others may be thinking about too, but Magic the Gathering

1389
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:33,712
Arena, I've been really enjoying it. Sorry folks. Magic the Gathering Arena, it's...

1390
01:21:34,338 --> 01:21:40,781
I've always been a big trading card game fan, so I've played a lot of Hearthstone for years.

1391
01:21:40,781 --> 01:21:46,444
And eventually, you know, in high school I used to play Magic the Gathering all the time

1392
01:21:46,444 --> 01:21:48,685
with my friends.

1393
01:21:48,685 --> 01:21:53,567
And apparently after playing Arena, a lot of our rules were wrong, that we thought they

1394
01:21:53,567 --> 01:21:53,747
were.

1395
01:21:53,747 --> 01:21:57,949
So we weren't really playing it the right way, apparently.

1396
01:21:57,949 --> 01:22:00,250
But it was still fun.

1397
01:22:01,325 --> 01:22:06,529
Their friend system isn't very good yet, but it'll get there.

1398
01:22:06,529 --> 01:22:08,010
But it's very polished.

1399
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:13,134
Every single button will have a cool animation around it.

1400
01:22:13,134 --> 01:22:16,077
And even when you're hovering over cards,

1401
01:22:16,077 --> 01:22:20,720
there'll be a separate subtle sound hovering over all of them.

1402
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:23,182
They all have a separate sound effect when you play it.

1403
01:22:23,182 --> 01:22:26,165
Something's really satisfying about it

1404
01:22:26,165 --> 01:22:29,668
whenever you play a card or even just

1405
01:22:31,075 --> 01:22:33,277
even just at the beginning of the match.

1406
01:22:33,277 --> 01:22:35,858
Or over time, when you have your set,

1407
01:22:35,858 --> 01:22:39,720
you can browse your whole set, sort of like Hearthstone,

1408
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,641
and look at it in awe.

1409
01:22:41,641 --> 01:22:47,284
There's something about it where I played the previous match

1410
01:22:47,284 --> 01:22:50,086
at the Gathering on lines where it was like Duel

1411
01:22:50,086 --> 01:22:51,787
of the Planeswalkers.

1412
01:22:51,787 --> 01:22:53,027
And I wasn't a fan.

1413
01:22:53,027 --> 01:22:56,009
It was OK for maybe like a week for me.

1414
01:22:56,009 --> 01:22:58,150
And then after that, I'm a bit bored.

1415
01:22:58,551 --> 01:23:00,552
And you have limited cards.

1416
01:23:00,552 --> 01:23:04,936
But here, they try to copy the experience of as if you're

1417
01:23:04,936 --> 01:23:06,757
just playing on a real tabletop.

1418
01:23:06,757 --> 01:23:11,820
They'll even, for those familiar with instant cards,

1419
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,821
you can even pause.

1420
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:16,924
There's a little pause in between to play your instant

1421
01:23:16,924 --> 01:23:20,186
cards each time, which, when you start, it can be a little

1422
01:23:20,186 --> 01:23:21,808
bit annoying, but you get used to it fast.

1423
01:23:21,808 --> 01:23:25,690
Overall, I've really been enjoying it.

1424
01:23:27,438 --> 01:23:33,944
So you think most of the aspects you say about this game is better than the same aspects in Hearthstone, right?

1425
01:23:33,944 --> 01:23:39,470
Yeah, I like them both, but right now I currently like Magic the Gathering Arena.

1426
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:48,619
Maybe it's just a change of pace because I've been playing Hearthstone for years, or maybe it's high school nostalgia.

1427
01:23:48,619 --> 01:23:48,899
Okay.

1428
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:49,160
Jonas?

1429
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,701
I'll skip for now.

1430
01:24:03,136 --> 01:24:12,984
I'm like I've been playing that game since it came out in like small bursts

1431
01:24:12,984 --> 01:24:19,950
like since moving to Taiwan I only got a PlayStation 4 yesterday after I had to

1432
01:24:19,950 --> 01:24:29,538
sell my UK one because it wouldn't work here so I have been sustaining myself on

1433
01:24:29,538 --> 01:24:30,619
collecting all the little tree guys

1434
01:24:31,181 --> 01:24:36,763
Yeah, I got like 700 out of 900 and it's getting difficult now.

1435
01:24:36,763 --> 01:24:47,268
But I just love that world. It's still after like, oh man, I don't even know how many hours I've played.

1436
01:24:47,268 --> 01:24:50,289
Maybe like 600 hours or something.

1437
01:24:50,289 --> 01:24:56,292
I still just love running around and doing stuff in that game. It's cool.

1438
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:58,432
I can totally imagine that.

1439
01:24:58,432 --> 01:25:00,373
How about Fernando?

1440
01:25:01,142 --> 01:25:02,743
Yeah, I played that game a lot too, I love it.

1441
01:25:02,743 --> 01:25:06,245
But another Nintendo game, I would say Super Smash Bros.

1442
01:25:06,245 --> 01:25:09,228
I've been playing a lot of that.

1443
01:25:09,228 --> 01:25:14,732
I played it with my brother-in-law, who's ex-marine, and makes us do push-ups whenever we lose.

1444
01:25:14,732 --> 01:25:17,033
So if you don't want to lose, yeah.

1445
01:25:17,033 --> 01:25:20,936
20 push-ups, or 20 squats, and you're real sore the next day if you lose a lot.

1446
01:25:20,936 --> 01:25:26,100
And that game actually influenced HunterNet a lot. Not this one, but the older ones.

1447
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,862
And I thought, well, Nintendo's cute, I like cute.

1448
01:25:29,636 --> 01:25:32,778
So that's like my Kirby flying multiplayer shooter idea,

1449
01:25:32,778 --> 01:25:36,940
but I learned that only Nintendo is really good at doing Q-pit.

1450
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:38,802
It's really hard to do it yourself.

1451
01:25:38,802 --> 01:25:41,483
But even until today, you play HunterNet, the new space

1452
01:25:41,483 --> 01:25:44,145
version, there's abilities in there

1453
01:25:44,145 --> 01:25:46,726
that were influenced by Smash Brothers.

1454
01:25:46,726 --> 01:25:49,028
In particular, in Smash Brothers,

1455
01:25:49,028 --> 01:25:51,069
you have the omnidirectional shields.

1456
01:25:51,069 --> 01:25:53,951
And in HunterNet, you have an absorb shield and a repel.

1457
01:25:55,623 --> 01:26:03,466
I can definitely see that now, because there are like 50 or 100 different items in Smash Bros. that each character can use.

1458
01:26:03,466 --> 01:26:09,528
And basically you sort of internalize that into the system you need to put onto the ship before battle.

1459
01:26:09,528 --> 01:26:11,188
Basically it's the same thing, right?

1460
01:26:11,188 --> 01:26:16,910
Yeah, and there's also, you know, when I made HunterNet, especially when I was going in the space direction,

1461
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:22,852
I played, you know, one of the first games I bought was X-Wing for DOS back in like 1993.

1462
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:30,909
And in my opinion, and I play a lot of flight simulators, that's probably the game I put on the death stat, is Isle 2 Stormovic.

1463
01:26:30,909 --> 01:26:31,369
Oh my god, yes.

1464
01:26:31,369 --> 01:26:37,412
And space games are just not, they don't have the depth of a flight simulator because they're missing gravity,

1465
01:26:37,412 --> 01:26:42,375
and you don't have energy fighting, the flight models just don't make sense.

1466
01:26:42,375 --> 01:26:51,219
And Smash Brothers, if you play 100Net today you'll notice that I, you can tell that I took some ideas from fighting games,

1467
01:26:51,219 --> 01:26:53,320
and mixed them into space combat.

1468
01:26:53,607 --> 01:26:59,831
to create a space combat game that, just like a good fighting game, can be fun.

1469
01:26:59,831 --> 01:27:04,454
One versus one in an empty rectangle, or in this case, an empty cube.

1470
01:27:04,454 --> 01:27:12,620
So yeah, Smash Bros. has been a huge inspiration and it's still one of my favorite games.

1471
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:15,361
Very interesting.

1472
01:27:15,361 --> 01:27:17,943
Two games that I enjoyed last year was...

1473
01:27:17,943 --> 01:27:22,086
One is a ROM hack of the original Zelda game from the past for the Super Nintendo.

1474
01:27:22,682 --> 01:27:26,643
So apparently there are people out there who...

1475
01:27:26,643 --> 01:27:30,764
You can play the original Zelda A Link to the Past on an emulator, right?

1476
01:27:30,764 --> 01:27:31,624
Everyone does that.

1477
01:27:31,624 --> 01:27:40,187
But apparently there are clever people out there who have figured out how to hack the ROM of Zelda

1478
01:27:40,187 --> 01:27:46,329
and just make a completely new Zelda game with the original A Link to the Past.

1479
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:55,822
graphics and music, and just the world is different and the story is different, and the dungeons are different, right?

1480
01:27:55,822 --> 01:27:58,825
And they are actually good.

1481
01:27:58,825 --> 01:28:02,268
Like, I was very surprised by the level of polish.

1482
01:28:02,268 --> 01:28:07,492
It's not Nintendo level of polish, but it's incredibly good.

1483
01:28:07,492 --> 01:28:12,777
Do you know which ROM packs? I assume there are many ROM packs in the game.

1484
01:28:12,777 --> 01:28:14,418
Oh, which one?

1485
01:28:14,418 --> 01:28:15,219
Parallel Worlds.

1486
01:28:29,862 --> 01:28:38,130
And the other game that I've enjoyed great this year was Factorio.

1487
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:39,611
Oh, Factorio.

1488
01:28:39,611 --> 01:28:50,581
Especially with friends, because there are not too many base-building or economy-building games out there that are multiplayer.

1489
01:28:50,581 --> 01:28:56,086
And I kind of like Farm Simulator or something.

1490
01:28:56,086 --> 01:28:56,907
But Factorio just...

1491
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:07,791
a thing to do while you hang out with your friends and you just chat in Discord and you

1492
01:29:07,791 --> 01:29:09,913
build up your factory a little bit.

1493
01:29:09,913 --> 01:29:12,955
But it can also be super intense and challenging.

1494
01:29:12,955 --> 01:29:17,718
If you haven't heard about the game, it's phenomenal.

1495
01:29:17,718 --> 01:29:22,081
And they are in early access, I believe.

1496
01:29:22,081 --> 01:29:25,163
They've been working on it for many, many years.

1497
01:29:25,163 --> 01:29:29,006
It's a very small studio in Eastern Europe.

1498
01:29:31,813 --> 01:29:33,374
Taipei Game Show.

1499
01:29:33,374 --> 01:29:35,835
Oh, they did?

1500
01:29:35,835 --> 01:29:36,435
Like, 2017, I think.

1501
01:29:36,435 --> 01:29:37,215
Yeah.

1502
01:29:37,215 --> 01:29:43,837
So, like, their first game show ever was actually in Taipei Game Show.

1503
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:44,377
Nice.

1504
01:29:44,377 --> 01:29:45,358
Yeah.

1505
01:29:45,358 --> 01:29:48,459
Did you personally meet them?

1506
01:29:48,459 --> 01:29:49,759
Yeah, I talked to them.

1507
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:50,519
Are they nice?

1508
01:29:50,519 --> 01:29:53,160
Yeah, they are really nice.

1509
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,080
Can you introduce me to them?

1510
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:59,422
Yeah, actually, we also have an indie developer that is...

1511
01:30:00,072 --> 01:30:06,455
super fan of Factorio and he went on to take pictures with them and

1512
01:30:06,455 --> 01:30:10,718
talk at length about the game with the developers.

1513
01:30:10,718 --> 01:30:19,663
I think they actually got a very good experience out of the WCG.

1514
01:30:19,663 --> 01:30:28,308
So actually we have been running for like 90 minutes, so I guess it's a good time to call it.

1515
01:30:29,983 --> 01:30:32,385
如果大家想要跟我們聊天的話

1516
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,226
如果大家想要展示什麼東西的話

1517
01:30:34,226 --> 01:30:35,286
就跟我們聊聊看吧

1518
01:30:35,286 --> 01:30:39,429
就跟我們聊聊看吧

1519
01:30:39,429 --> 01:30:39,709
就這樣吧

1520
01:30:58,942 --> 01:31:02,783
那我們先間斷休息一下

1521
01:31:02,783 --> 01:31:04,684
那等一下有兩位在場的朋友

1522
01:31:04,684 --> 01:31:06,905
他可能想要借用前面的投影機

1523
01:31:06,905 --> 01:31:09,726
來秀一下他們想要介紹的東西

1524
01:31:09,726 --> 01:31:12,267
那我們就大概花個十分鐘上個廁所

1525
01:31:12,267 --> 01:31:14,367
然後大家可以喝個茶這樣子

1526
01:31:14,367 --> 01:31:15,428
先感謝今天大家的參與

1527
01:31:21,907 --> 01:31:27,129
所以我會跟觀眾說,如果有任何作品想要秀,你要給前面的宇團人看,還是你要秀給其他朋友,都隨意這樣。

1528
01:31:27,129 --> 01:31:28,769
好,那就請大家掌聲鼓勵這些宇團人這樣子。
