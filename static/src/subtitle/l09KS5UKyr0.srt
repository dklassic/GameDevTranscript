1
00:00:00,998 --> 00:00:04,299
如果你用中文可以幫他翻譯?

2
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:04,800
什麼?

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,643
OK, so yeah, use English, but if you have...

4
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:24,190
My Chinese is terrible. One of these people will try to translate.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,512
Any questions?

6
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:28,493
有沒有我剛剛對,就是,第一個講到的東西有問題?

7
00:00:34,563 --> 00:00:36,623
我想請問一下就是

8
00:00:36,623 --> 00:00:40,144
我看你們的遊戲是需要16個人玩的

9
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:44,605
那因為要16個人

10
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:46,225
16個人同時玩你們遊戲

11
00:00:46,225 --> 00:00:49,586
那你們線上人數應該是要蠻多的

12
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:52,687
你們是怎麼樣保持就是

13
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:54,507
一直線上一直有人

14
00:00:54,507 --> 00:00:56,388
或者是就是這個狀況

15
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:56,588
所以

16
00:00:59,778 --> 00:01:04,420
What we do is, we use Photon right now.

17
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,241
Photon are online multiplayer game servers.

18
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:12,102
And, Photon, they're built for scalability.

19
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:17,123
So, whether you have one or two people playing or...

20
00:01:17,123 --> 00:01:21,644
Sorry, Dylan, I think he was asking sort of about community engagement problem,

21
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:23,785
it's not technical problem.

22
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:25,345
Oh, community engagement problem.

23
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:33,290
How did you kickstart this community at first?

24
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,793
How did you get the first 100 people, first 200 people in?

25
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:39,835
Okay, so this was a big challenge.

26
00:01:39,835 --> 00:01:41,877
This is a really good question.

27
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:45,760
So, you have to market where you can

28
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:53,466
and try to pull people in through one central hub.

29
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:55,447
In our case, we use Discord.

30
00:01:55,983 --> 00:02:02,767
Later on, we'll throw them to different places like Facebook, and Forum, and Reddit, and

31
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:03,788
all that stuff.

32
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:10,353
But early, you want to concentrate on one hub, because you don't want people watering

33
00:02:10,353 --> 00:02:12,514
out to different hubs.

34
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:16,857
So if you don't use Discord, you can use anything else.

35
00:02:16,857 --> 00:02:18,839
You can use a forum or something.

36
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:24,182
Anything as long as it's one place where people can live chat.

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,163
or at least post really easily.

38
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:33,685
So we put links everywhere, doing everything.

39
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:39,489
So when we have YouTube, we have YouTube videos playing.

40
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:41,650
I'll do like devlogs or something, where I'll say,

41
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,792
hey, I'm going to give you two minutes to show

42
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:47,514
what I've been doing, what I've been developing,

43
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:48,355
sort of like a video blog.

44
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:51,877
And underneath, I'll put the link, join our Discord.

45
00:02:51,877 --> 00:02:52,757
And I'll post.

46
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,446
I'll post in a forum and I'll say, join our Discord.

47
00:02:56,446 --> 00:02:58,667
I'll put my signature, join our Discord.

48
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:02,750
So everything is all about rallying people

49
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,311
to this one place.

50
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:07,413
And so we have, at the beginning,

51
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:10,734
we had the one page website that just had the email form,

52
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:11,535
email signups.

53
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:15,577
So when we sent out the email, we would also say,

54
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:20,000
at the bottom and top of every email, join our Discord.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,682
So we're sort of bugging people, but it works.

56
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:27,560
and we really want to push them to this one central place.

57
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,321
And so when we had our alpha, we only

58
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:35,721
had an average of zero people online.

59
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:38,522
So it was pretty embarrassing.

60
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:43,423
And since we need 16 people to play, or 16 people

61
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,663
is the most fun.

62
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:48,443
Eight you can play, but it's like if you

63
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:50,464
played an MMO by yourself.

64
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,064
It's not very fun.

65
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,502
But even then, what I did was, when people were in Discord,

66
00:03:58,502 --> 00:04:03,144
I made a bot that would detect when people would play.

67
00:04:03,144 --> 00:04:05,786
And whenever someone would make a game,

68
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:08,027
it would announce to everyone, the robot,

69
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:09,567
the bot would say, hey everyone,

70
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:12,209
this person just made a game, everyone should join.

71
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,151
And if you use Steam, you can have a link.

72
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:19,332
You know those links that you can click on

73
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:21,894
and it goes to an application instead of a website?

74
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:24,026
We used one of those.

75
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:26,207
You say, hey, everyone, click here to join him.

76
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:27,987
If you have the game.

77
00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:30,248
So when you click it, it would launch the game.

78
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:33,329
So they wouldn't even have to look for the game.

79
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:35,249
They just need to click the link, and it'll

80
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:37,450
launch the game for them.

81
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,690
And that really helped, too.

82
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,651
And then at the end, it would say,

83
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,932
the bot would give a summary and tell everyone else

84
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:47,952
to join the second game.

85
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,822
And so the bot would sort of help people get together,

86
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:55,763
and it would sort of ping them if you're here, too.

87
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,824
We have a rank you can join.

88
00:04:57,824 --> 00:04:59,605
If you join this rank, you'll be pinged

89
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:01,806
whenever someone gets online.

90
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:04,787
So yeah, it was very, very difficult.

91
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:09,209
But you've got to try everything to get people rallied.

92
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,570
It's a lot of work at the beginning.

93
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:19,851
Do you think doing a Kickstarter campaign sort of helped you get this initial mass of people?

94
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:28,716
No. Kickstarter didn't help as much as we thought. It really did not help as much as we thought.

95
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:37,701
So we were a bit disappointed for the results when it comes to being covered by media or getting extra people to join.

96
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:39,662
I don't think it did that much, to be honest.

97
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:48,130
You may want to invest time and resources into just doing other things for marketing and getting the community together

98
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,191
whatever you can whatever you can do, but

99
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:56,894
What our secret was just getting in people little by little so when I said earlier market early

100
00:05:56,894 --> 00:05:58,916
I mean literally two years later

101
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:02,097
That's when we finally started to have a bunch of people

102
00:06:02,097 --> 00:06:08,121
Just a little bit out of time one person would join per day, and then maybe three people will join per day

103
00:06:08,554 --> 00:06:10,215
And it's very slow.

104
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:13,196
But you still, even when you have just a few people,

105
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:13,997
you need to talk to them.

106
00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:15,978
Because as indie developers, this

107
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:20,120
is something that we can do that AAA developers cannot do.

108
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,801
We can talk to the community.

109
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:23,761
And they think that is awesome.

110
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:25,782
That's what gets them to stay.

111
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:29,164
That you can participate directly with the community.

112
00:06:29,164 --> 00:06:31,085
That if you have an alpha or beta,

113
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:34,166
maybe you can play with them sometimes.

114
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:38,521
他們會告訴其他人,哇,這個社群好酷,你們應該加入,甚至開發者會跟你們說話

115
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:38,981
這對我們有很大的幫助

116
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:06,248
然後你就必須要先準備

117
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:09,671
然後Kickstarter的人喔

118
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:10,491
我發現就是會給我們

119
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:13,613
一百塊一百五甚至五百塊美金的那些人

120
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:15,935
其實他們根本不玩遊戲

121
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,397
所以我之後我們有一大堆名單

122
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,558
但是我一直寄email給他們

123
00:07:20,558 --> 00:07:22,319
可是他們就是完全不玩遊戲的人

124
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,302
所以Kickstarter的族群跟遊戲

125
00:07:26,302 --> 00:07:28,063
跟有玩家的族群是不一樣

126
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:30,064
然後你去跟玩家講說

127
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:31,145
拜託來贊助我們一下

128
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:32,266
可是他們不一定會來

129
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:36,210
因為他們就是要花小錢玩遊戲的人

130
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,994
所以他們其實基本上不會幫助你募資

131
00:07:38,994 --> 00:07:43,859
所以我們就發現說募資並沒有真的幫助我們在用戶

132
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:46,863
就是真的遊戲玩家上面

133
00:07:46,863 --> 00:07:49,927
那真的幫助我們可能是封測Alpha和Beta

134
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:52,788
我們在Alpha的時候真的很struggle

135
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:54,488
他真的每天晚上想說

136
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:56,869
天啊 明天如果只有七個人怎麼辦

137
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:59,149
然後可能我們

138
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:02,870
因為我們的粉絲就是散佈在世界各地

139
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,630
然後就是終於有七個人了

140
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,211
然後沒有 就是終於第八個人加入了

141
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:08,811
然後結果這個人去睡覺了

142
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:11,832
然後所以又只好再繼續等

143
00:08:11,832 --> 00:08:13,633
然後之後我就說

144
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:14,473
請我們的那個設計師

145
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:16,673
就是我們的2D Artist

146
00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:18,514
我想說拜託你玩一下好不好

147
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:19,754
特惠人數也好

148
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:19,954
所以

149
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:22,695
Alpha就是真的很重要

150
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:24,955
那個時間會慢慢幫助你

151
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:27,175
就是持續成長

152
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:29,756
不要等到最後一刻才發現

153
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:30,756
我是多人的

154
00:08:30,756 --> 00:08:32,056
我需要人來支持我

155
00:08:49,721 --> 00:09:04,471
Discord was already open. During our Kickstarter, we used Discord as the main thing to rally people, because we have instant access to them.

156
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:09,695
How many people were on Discord and how many were on Steam?

157
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:17,060
Oh, during Alpha? We still had a decent amount of people during Alpha, but not that many.

158
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:20,993
I think we had about 2,000 people during Alpha.

159
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,274
But just on Discord.

160
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:26,056
But it doesn't mean they're online.

161
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:27,397
It just means that they're there.

162
00:09:27,397 --> 00:09:28,058
The browser is open.

163
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:28,638
It's open somewhere.

164
00:09:28,638 --> 00:09:31,100
And they may be in a different server.

165
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,662
Because you can have different servers.

166
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:35,363
It's like you're in Steam.

167
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:38,405
It doesn't mean you're playing one specific game.

168
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:42,528
Or maybe you're not even there.

169
00:09:47,567 --> 00:10:03,602
When the game is released, how do you prepare for it?

170
00:10:14,234 --> 00:10:17,055
Our beta started, when we released the beta,

171
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:18,636
it started getting more popular.

172
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:20,877
And then the streamers started to come in more.

173
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:23,339
So that really helped us prepare for our release more.

174
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,900
Because there were actually players.

175
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,522
So there was always at least one full game going.

176
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:30,582
One or two games going always.

177
00:10:30,582 --> 00:10:32,043
So that helped.

178
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:35,685
So then when we launched, we really rallied everyone

179
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:37,266
way ahead of time.

180
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,866
We kept counting down.

181
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:41,728
So we'll say, oh, 30 days, 29 days, 28 days.

182
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:47,397
Everyone's probably bugged at us by then, but it really sort of got put in their mind.

183
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,440
So that everyone joined that one day.

184
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:57,165
And when we launched, we got everyone to stream the game at the same time on Twitch.

185
00:10:57,165 --> 00:11:00,468
And so suddenly, it got really popular on Twitch.

186
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:06,933
And we also got lucky and had a famous Twitch streamer named Lyric play our game.

187
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:11,157
And so we didn't even know he played it, but suddenly there's a huge burst of people.

188
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:15,694
And it was because this Twitch guy was streaming.

189
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:20,556
So that really helped our initial population.

190
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:24,518
Be sure to talk to Twitch streamers

191
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,079
and hand them free keys.

192
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:30,420
And they will play your game.

193
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,881
I mean, you handed them free keys,

194
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:34,822
and you give them extra keys to give away.

195
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:36,963
Because if you just give them one, you know, it's sort of cool.

196
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:37,843
You got a free game.

197
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:40,505
But I'm sure they get free games all the time.

198
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:45,041
給他們四個鑰匙,然後他們會有三個鑰匙,可能給一個朋友,或是兩個給別人

199
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:55,046
所以Twitch的直播者想要有一個交流,所以你給他們一些東西,讓他們可以和觀眾交流,他們就更有可能會玩你的遊戲

200
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:56,746
我覺得Twitch幫了我們很多

201
00:11:56,746 --> 00:12:07,571
我們一開始的時候,US的玩家比較多,然後就常常會有EU的人

202
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:12,086
傳私訊給我說我這裡沒有八個人

203
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:13,667
你有沒有更多人

204
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,828
但是我現在問題是台灣這邊沒有辦法玩

205
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:18,609
像我有一些香港玩家他們就會說

206
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:21,711
為什麼這一區的人都沒有

207
00:12:21,711 --> 00:12:25,393
就是這個時間time zone的地方都沒有人

208
00:12:25,393 --> 00:12:28,274
所以我那個時候我就target EU

209
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:29,935
就是Facebook ads

210
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:30,816
我就可以設定

211
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,859
EU的Player Bags

212
00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:36,341
然後或是Google Apps

213
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:39,544
就是只好用這個方式去跟他們廣告

214
00:12:39,544 --> 00:12:42,647
然後或者是說我就可能問他說

215
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:48,393
欸那在你那個國家裡面你們最常看的實況主是誰

216
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,956
我就會去想辦法去開發那個地方

217
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:54,399
因為畢竟他是當那邊的人

218
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,879
所以他可能會

219
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:01,384
很懂,像如果不是台灣的玩家的話,他們可能不知道我們最常用的平台是什麼

220
00:13:01,384 --> 00:13:05,606
所以我就是只好用這樣的方式一步一步去慢慢做

221
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:10,610
就是可能不要太緊張,也不要太覺得說

222
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,852
啊,我們好像沒有辦法reach到他們

223
00:13:13,852 --> 00:13:16,333
可是其實他們真的想玩的話,他們會找你

224
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:32,836
For playtesting, we used Steam, but we didn't do early access.

225
00:13:32,836 --> 00:13:40,179
We used Steam only as the platform so that we can generate keys and give it to people,

226
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:47,182
and people trust Steam as a platform, and so we just used Steam.

227
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:49,303
But we would organize in Discord.

228
00:13:49,303 --> 00:13:52,724
I mean, like...

229
00:13:52,724 --> 00:13:54,005
Technically?

230
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:55,365
Not technically.

231
00:13:55,692 --> 00:13:57,673
How do you observe the player action?

232
00:13:57,673 --> 00:13:59,634
What do you do? And what feature is fun?

233
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:03,996
What feature is not? How do you determine these features?

234
00:14:03,996 --> 00:14:06,378
A lot of fun has to do with balance.

235
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:11,020
If you have a game that requires balance,

236
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:18,264
like if you think League of Legends or our game, balance is very important.

237
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:24,067
You can add stats. Remember earlier I said game sparks.

238
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,627
Well, that's server-side.

239
00:14:25,627 --> 00:14:29,409
So every time they play a game, at the end, I send stats to

240
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:29,809
our server.

241
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:33,812
Or you can use, a good website is Game Analytics.

242
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:35,093
Game Analytics is free.

243
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:37,494
And it's especially good for mobile sites.

244
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:39,896
They have a lot of extra stuff for mobile, if you do

245
00:14:39,896 --> 00:14:42,618
something like that.

246
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:43,358
But any platform.

247
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:46,560
And from there, you can aggregate stats.

248
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,483
It'll show, like, you can calculate win-loss ratios with

249
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:52,524
a certain class.

250
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,345
You can calculate.

251
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:58,436
Does the average person have 50% wins or losses?

252
00:14:58,436 --> 00:15:01,099
So you just have a bunch of stats,

253
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:02,480
and you send it to your server.

254
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,183
And again, you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

255
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:11,607
Use a platform that already does this for you.

256
00:15:11,607 --> 00:15:14,689
In our case, GameSparks or Game Analytics.

257
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:17,211
We use both just in case there's discrepancy.

258
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:19,153
So you can compare.

259
00:15:21,643 --> 00:15:26,606
我講的可能比較不專業,但是是跟玩家最直接接觸的

260
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:29,669
其實線上的酸民跟玩家是非常直接的

261
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:34,432
所以如果真的你的遊戲有不順或是不夠好或不好玩的地方

262
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:36,233
你馬上就會知道了,因為他們就會立刻來跟你抱怨

263
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:46,380
Never let me do complaints, this is not fun, please fix this

264
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,882
You will know

265
00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:53,756
Yeah, we did internal playtest too.

266
00:15:53,756 --> 00:15:56,777
What we did is we played with our moderators.

267
00:15:56,777 --> 00:16:00,679
So we have community moderators, and maybe at the time

268
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,140
we had maybe like four or five.

269
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,462
And then we would also play with our Kickstarter backers

270
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:07,342
too to fill in some blanks.

271
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,504
And so whoever was there, we would invite,

272
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:14,546
because we didn't have that many people at the time.

273
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:16,847
And so we would just rally.

274
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:19,388
Scheduling was good too.

275
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:24,134
People from all different time zones wanted to play,

276
00:16:24,134 --> 00:16:28,495
but it's really hard to get 8 to 16 people for our game.

277
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:30,076
It was really difficult.

278
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:32,837
So we would schedule persistent times.

279
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:34,857
And we had to have two separate ones.

280
00:16:34,857 --> 00:16:36,478
There was no one perfect time.

281
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:40,279
So you have one that focuses on Europe,

282
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,440
and the other time that focuses on US.

283
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,021
And so we just did a survey to see what time

284
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:49,482
was the best for each one.

285
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:58,126
And so, in our case, we used, I think it was 9pm Eastern,

286
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:01,007
and, oh, I forgot the European one,

287
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:05,408
I'll have to get back to you, you can ask me later,

288
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:08,329
but it was split up in two different time zones

289
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:13,730
to make it persistent, and no plan for it.

290
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,550
So, did you do anything like physical,

291
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,911
face to face?

292
00:17:20,352 --> 00:17:23,934
We did zero face-to-face playtesting.

293
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:25,055
Because, um...

294
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:27,216
Is it impossible?

295
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:29,677
No, it's not that it's impossible.

296
00:17:29,677 --> 00:17:35,500
It's just, it's a lot of work, and it takes a lot of, um...

297
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,181
You know, we only have two programmers, so to us it's a lot of effort.

298
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:39,882
And we may have to...

299
00:17:39,882 --> 00:17:43,985
If we wanted, like, a physical place to test, we'd have to pay.

300
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:49,047
And, you know, we didn't have any money to rent a place or anything like that.

301
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:56,774
And it would be sort of awkward if we just invite them to our home.

302
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:57,054
So...

303
00:17:57,054 --> 00:17:58,815
Any other questions?

304
00:17:58,815 --> 00:18:02,275
We have a question on the stream.

305
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:07,596
How do you decide how much you want for Kickstarter?

306
00:18:07,596 --> 00:18:12,057
How do you decide how much you want for Kickstarter?

307
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:18,338
So to decide how much you want for Kickstarter,

308
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:23,016
If we're talking about what we did when we went for $20,000,

309
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:30,681
we thought that we want to calculate developer expenses.

310
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:35,003
We want to calculate enough for you to survive until launch.

311
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:39,706
And that's the biggest thing, because after your Kickstarter,

312
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:42,188
you do have to distribute to the team members, too.

313
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:46,391
You need some for yourself to survive

314
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,232
so that you can go full time.

315
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:55,366
And then you also need some for assets and further development.

316
00:18:55,366 --> 00:18:58,308
Not everything will be free.

317
00:18:58,308 --> 00:19:02,630
Like game servers, like Photon, for example, when we use that.

318
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,931
Once we started play testing, once you

319
00:19:04,931 --> 00:19:07,233
go over a limit of maybe five people,

320
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,334
they'll start charging you.

321
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:14,536
And so you need to think when you want to launch.

322
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:15,697
And you calculate how long you'll

323
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:16,898
survive until you launch.

324
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,946
and then maybe plus an extra few months for buffer,

325
00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:24,427
because you never know what extras you'll need.

326
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:28,088
There's always hidden stuff that you forgot about.

327
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:33,409
So you want more than what you expect.

328
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:37,630
For example, we thought it would take maybe about 15,000

329
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,130
to be perfect, ideal.

330
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,430
Ideally, we'd have 15,000.

331
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,491
So we went for the goal of 20,000,

332
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:45,052
so we have the extra 5,000.

333
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:50,915
buffer, so that just in case if something happens, then we're

334
00:19:50,915 --> 00:19:51,395
covered.

335
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:52,215
We don't have to worry.

336
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:54,416
We never want to worry about it.

337
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:58,937
But how about how do you design different tiers of rewards?

338
00:19:58,937 --> 00:20:02,398
OK, for different tiers of rewards, this is the hardest

339
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:03,738
part of a Kickstarter.

340
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:07,039
This takes a lot of work and effort.

341
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,039
So in our case, we had a shared Google Doc.

342
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,520
And we brought all of our team members in there.

343
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,780
And we're trying to

344
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:19,023
At first, you just come up with ideas.

345
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:23,786
So before you organize anything, just simply

346
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:27,368
put a whole bunch of ideas for what rewards we can give

347
00:20:27,368 --> 00:20:31,370
and maybe some different money tiers.

348
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,111
So do we want to award people for $5?

349
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:38,454
In our case, we didn't give anything for $5.

350
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:41,095
$5 was just donation only.

351
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:43,977
So we put the minimum as $10.

352
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:49,097
buy one and get one free.

353
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:52,718
And yeah, you just have to dump all your ideas

354
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:53,718
in a shared document.

355
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:56,979
And then of those, move the good ideas

356
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:59,319
to a different section.

357
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:03,700
And then from there, you can decide what tier.

358
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,961
And then also, you have to think psychologically, too.

359
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:11,182
So you think, if someone's looking at a $10 tier,

360
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:15,123
if they look one down, are they encouraged to jump?

361
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:20,487
Are you encouraged to jump if you were a player looking at this?

362
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:25,510
If I saw $10 to $20 in my head, I think, that's double the price.

363
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,590
I don't know.

364
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:33,114
But, if you see $19, you're like, hmm, it's just a little bit more.

365
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:35,275
It's a psychology thing.

366
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:40,278
People are more likely to go to $19 than $20 when you're jumping from $10.

367
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:45,240
We have to think that way too.

368
00:21:46,180 --> 00:22:01,473
We have to make sure that each tier they get a better deal than if they won less.

369
00:22:01,473 --> 00:22:02,133
OK嗎?還是等他回覆比較快?

370
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:04,075
Hopefully that's OK.

371
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:09,600
We don't know if he's still on chat.

372
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,823
現場還有其他的問題嗎?還是大家還在想?

373
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:20,933
I'll ask a few questions. It's probably more about game design.

374
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:29,315
So, I think one of the unique feature or unique game mechanic in the game is that

375
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:33,496
you have a very powerful class like King.

376
00:22:33,496 --> 00:22:39,917
So, I remember my second game.

377
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:44,518
I tried a game in my second game and I was assigned as...

378
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:55,329
And I think, I don't know, it's like, there's interesting that you have very powerful classes like that,

379
00:22:55,329 --> 00:22:58,710
and you try to balance it out with all other classes.

380
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:06,214
But also it's kind of a stressful thing for new players to come in and have, you know,

381
00:23:06,214 --> 00:23:09,376
play a sign of very important or very, like...

382
00:23:09,376 --> 00:23:11,437
Critical role.

383
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:13,138
Yeah, or a very special role.

384
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:14,076
我會把這個問題解釋給觀眾聽

385
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:47,867
都要靠事後推理

386
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:49,948
然後很困難的地方是

387
00:23:49,948 --> 00:23:50,108
這個國王

388
00:23:50,108 --> 00:23:53,109
因為大家都知道他是國王

389
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:54,710
他是第一個被公開的作者

390
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,290
自動就會公開

391
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,431
然後這個國王通常都會很主動的

392
00:23:57,431 --> 00:23:59,251
就是跟所有人要說

393
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:01,012
就是請所有人

394
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:04,293
跟我這個國王回報你的職業

395
00:24:04,293 --> 00:24:07,274
那這個國王才能依序做他後續的動作

396
00:24:07,274 --> 00:24:08,955
或者是說假如他是邪惡的國王的話

397
00:24:08,955 --> 00:24:10,636
他要怎麼樣去害別人

398
00:24:10,636 --> 00:24:12,676
但是我第一次玩的時候我就被

399
00:24:20,523 --> 00:24:21,423
就更不方便了

400
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:56,513
We actually already have plans to split the modes into an easy mode, like a simple, you're

401
00:24:56,513 --> 00:25:03,297
learning mode, and then the classic mode, which has everything.

402
00:25:03,297 --> 00:25:07,480
And so we're also trying to restrict harder classes.

403
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:09,127
to new players.

404
00:25:09,127 --> 00:25:11,607
So remember I said you should record stats?

405
00:25:11,607 --> 00:25:17,169
One of the stats that we record is games played.

406
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:20,749
So now we can see, oh, you only played five games?

407
00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:23,730
We're not going to randomly give you

408
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,070
the hardest class in the game.

409
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:30,971
And you may become that class through in-game mechanics,

410
00:25:30,971 --> 00:25:35,212
but we're not going to start you as the hardest class ever.

411
00:25:35,212 --> 00:25:37,313
Ends.

412
00:25:38,191 --> 00:25:41,672
Yeah, that was definitely a mistake that we have learned.

413
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:45,774
And we're trying very hard to ramp the new player experience.

414
00:25:45,774 --> 00:25:51,136
So I wish we would have done this a long time ago.

415
00:25:51,136 --> 00:25:55,898
It's just, we just didn't have the resources at the time.

416
00:25:55,898 --> 00:25:59,720
We could have, but instead we did different things.

417
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,061
So my advice to all of you guys is

418
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:06,022
think of, to pretend that you are a new player, or even.

419
00:26:06,477 --> 00:26:10,039
get someone that's never played your game and watch them play

420
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,240
and ask them to think out loud.

421
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,901
Because it should be intuitive.

422
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:17,644
And they should know what to do on the first time playing.

423
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:19,785
And if they don't, then that's a problem

424
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:21,806
and it probably needs to be changed.

425
00:26:21,806 --> 00:26:26,009
And in case of his question, he was one of the players

426
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:29,832
that made us, players like him made us realize, oh no,

427
00:26:29,832 --> 00:26:31,373
we made a mistake.

428
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:33,354
We need to make, we need to.

429
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:40,228
make harder classes assigned to the veteran players.

430
00:26:40,228 --> 00:26:43,249
So we need new classes,

431
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:47,970
the harder classes need to go to the people that have played tons of games.

432
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,590
They all know what to do.

433
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,631
But as for newer players, it may make them

434
00:26:52,631 --> 00:26:54,791
freak out a little and run away.

435
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:57,112
They may think that all games are like this.

436
00:26:57,112 --> 00:26:59,672
Let's say it was your first game, playing that,

437
00:26:59,672 --> 00:27:01,153
as the hardest class in the game.

438
00:27:02,147 --> 00:27:05,668
you may think that this whole game is like this and you're not going to play anymore.

439
00:27:05,668 --> 00:27:07,428
You may have quit after your first game.

440
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:13,910
That's also about community engagement as well.

441
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,771
Because most of the players currently in the room

442
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:21,691
probably are experienced.

443
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:24,592
If you are assigned as a king, then people would

444
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:28,713
expect you to behave like a king.

445
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:34,755
Yeah, they are like, what are you doing?

446
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:35,895
I'm going to report you.

447
00:27:35,895 --> 00:27:40,318
Yeah, that's the funny thing that happened.

448
00:27:40,318 --> 00:27:47,082
Also, the players play as Prince, and he just killed everyone he jailed.

449
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:47,462
Yeah.

450
00:27:47,462 --> 00:27:54,846
What we're going to do really soon is we're going to force a scripted tutorial.

451
00:27:54,846 --> 00:28:00,550
And so it'll guide you through it, and it won't teach you the advanced classes, but...

452
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:06,128
if you do run into the advanced class, at least you have a concept of what to do.

453
00:28:06,128 --> 00:28:11,309
Because a lot of people, like Elsa, she'll want to just skip the tutorial.

454
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:14,250
A tutorial will come up and say, this is the most important thing.

455
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,690
She'll go, skip.

456
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:20,091
So players don't like being forced into stuff like this.

457
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:24,371
But if you have a game where you have to be knowledgeable,

458
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:28,832
and it's a multiplayer game where it affects others, then.

459
00:28:29,728 --> 00:28:32,730
If you 100% want to force a tutorial

460
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:37,613
Don't make it long, just enough to where they know the basics

461
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:42,015
You know, we have some buttons they can click for advance stuff

462
00:28:42,015 --> 00:28:48,338
But we won't force the advance stuff on them, advance guides

463
00:28:48,338 --> 00:28:52,480
But for the basics, force the tutorial, 100%

464
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:04,555
How long do you expect to continue maintaining and running the game?

465
00:29:04,555 --> 00:29:06,156
Because it's an online game and

466
00:29:06,156 --> 00:29:08,217
we have expectations.

467
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:11,219
This is one of those types of games

468
00:29:11,219 --> 00:29:15,922
where people can play for a very long time and not get bored because of the replay value.

469
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:19,204
And so we expect it to go even longer than ten years.

470
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:22,246
So that's a big reason why

471
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:24,188
we decided to do online multiplayer.

472
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:37,217
is because we want that community, and we want them to keep playing for a very, very long time.

473
00:29:37,217 --> 00:29:44,862
I think this game is like a board game that many people get in a room and play it.

474
00:29:44,862 --> 00:29:48,744
So have you considered using VR?

475
00:29:48,744 --> 00:29:53,227
Yeah, we actually have.

476
00:29:53,662 --> 00:30:00,703
You know, you see games like Werewolves Within that has this sort of concept that you're physically in the same room with each other.

477
00:30:00,703 --> 00:30:06,464
And, you know, we're definitely inspired by that. We do want to look into this one day.

478
00:30:06,464 --> 00:30:11,966
It's definitely not our high priority list, but I'm a huge fan of HTC Vive, and I want one one day.

479
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:15,746
And this will be how I'll experiment.

480
00:30:15,746 --> 00:30:22,128
We can start simple by just, you know, pop the UI out, make it so you can look around, instead of like a spinny camera.

481
00:30:25,252 --> 00:30:26,733
HTC Vive

482
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:27,954
And it's...

483
00:30:27,954 --> 00:30:32,417
I don't recommend it for like a game only with VR

484
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:35,739
Unless you have tons of money

485
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:37,981
But you know, adding VR support

486
00:30:37,981 --> 00:30:40,643
I looked at some of the API documentation

487
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:41,624
It doesn't look very...

488
00:30:41,624 --> 00:30:44,006
It doesn't look bad

489
00:30:44,006 --> 00:30:45,707
It looks sort of easy to do

490
00:30:45,707 --> 00:30:51,772
Easy as in like, you know, once you learn the basics anyway

491
00:30:51,772 --> 00:30:54,754
小伙子有嗎?

492
00:30:54,754 --> 00:30:55,074
有啦,我聽不懂

493
00:31:00,055 --> 00:31:03,018
page in your presentation, you were talking about the

494
00:31:03,018 --> 00:31:07,681
Steam page, the coming soon page, before you actually

495
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:09,423
opened up the store.

496
00:31:09,423 --> 00:31:14,226
Because we know that Steam has a dedicated page view for new

497
00:31:14,226 --> 00:31:20,811
titles, I remember there was like one million page views or

498
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:23,213
something, like the first.

499
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:28,277
First 30 days, they'll give you extra from launch.

500
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:29,258
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

501
00:31:30,227 --> 00:31:31,447
starting from launch or starting from?

502
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:32,988
It starts from launch.

503
00:31:32,988 --> 00:31:36,831
So you can have it, don't be afraid to have your store early.

504
00:31:36,831 --> 00:31:38,692
You can have it be as early as you want.

505
00:31:38,692 --> 00:31:43,435
Once you launch, that's when you get the special 30 day

506
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:46,116
promotion where they'll push traffic to you.

507
00:31:46,116 --> 00:31:53,161
And on top of that, oh, I guess NDA stuff, I can't say too

508
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:58,024
much about it, but in general, they'll promote you

509
00:31:58,024 --> 00:31:59,385
every now and then.

510
00:32:03,168 --> 00:32:04,068
有沒有其他問題?

511
00:32:04,068 --> 00:32:04,088
有嗎?

512
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:08,270
有人其他問題嗎?

513
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,490
這邊好像有一個

514
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:40,798
Our marketing budget was about $200 per month, and so we spent that on Facebook.

515
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:47,681
We split it between Facebook and Google ads, and later on we tried some YouTube.

516
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:51,283
I really like the YouTube ads, if you have a decent trailer.

517
00:32:52,624 --> 00:32:55,746
Our budget was really low for them.

518
00:32:55,746 --> 00:33:01,689
But then post-launch, our budget is, we spend about $1,500

519
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:04,711
per month now for ads in the same things.

520
00:33:04,711 --> 00:33:08,393
So Facebook, YouTube, Google Ads.

521
00:33:08,393 --> 00:33:11,315
We're still investigating how much of an impact

522
00:33:11,315 --> 00:33:14,637
it is because we only recently started

523
00:33:14,637 --> 00:33:17,439
upping the budget for our ads.

524
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:19,200
So I can't tell you yet if it worked or not.

525
00:33:19,796 --> 00:33:24,418
We're about to find an analyst to take a look at it,

526
00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:27,660
make sure that it's doing something.

527
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,562
So yeah, if you plan to do ads,

528
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:37,545
find someone that can analyze it and make sure that it's working.

529
00:33:37,545 --> 00:33:44,068
So you're not very sure about how much of a conversion rate you have right now?

530
00:33:44,068 --> 00:33:46,369
We know that the click rate is pretty high.

531
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:50,100
That was the main point of the $200 a month for a while,

532
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:56,023
is you have to spend money at first to mold it the way you want to.

533
00:33:56,023 --> 00:34:01,645
So you want a high click-through rate and very low click prices.

534
00:34:01,645 --> 00:34:03,346
And that takes a while to get.

535
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:06,027
But now we have that, and that's where we're starting to experiment

536
00:34:06,027 --> 00:34:07,768
and raise the budget.

537
00:34:07,768 --> 00:34:12,710
And so you want a very high CTR, the click-through rate,

538
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,851
and that's sort of the best bang for the buck.

539
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:16,292
Do you have the next question here?

540
00:34:16,982 --> 00:34:18,723
it's the best value you can get.

541
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:25,989
I don't recommend ads until

542
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:30,552
I don't recommend ads until way later.

543
00:34:30,552 --> 00:34:35,755
I do recommend putting just a little bit into ads to try to get that

544
00:34:35,755 --> 00:34:40,018
try to mess with the CTR and how much you pay per click

545
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:43,701
and try to, you know, that takes a little while to get perfect.

546
00:34:49,731 --> 00:35:11,085
Facebook來的玩家,他們留的時間比較久,也比較,錯錯錯,我更正,Facebook來的玩家數量比較多,但是Google來的玩家,Google ads來的玩家留的比較久,所以他們的興趣是停留比較久的,但是Facebook可能只是,

547
00:35:11,682 --> 00:35:12,323
一下下的

548
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:14,644
然後Facebook的廣告

549
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:16,766
如果你用Drift或是Video

550
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:18,407
是效益是比較高的

551
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,747
然後不要

552
00:35:19,747 --> 00:35:21,629
不要在Twitter上

553
00:35:21,629 --> 00:35:21,789
用廣告

554
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:24,390
Twitter廣告沒有很理想

555
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,912
然後YouTube是

556
00:35:26,912 --> 00:35:28,553
我覺得YouTube Ad是

557
00:35:28,553 --> 00:35:30,114
一定要做的

558
00:35:30,694 --> 00:35:33,695
可是它不是在於說給多少人看到

559
00:35:33,695 --> 00:35:35,856
而是在於你的那個view count

560
00:35:35,856 --> 00:35:39,717
就是你這個video被人看過幾遍

561
00:35:39,717 --> 00:35:42,238
那其實那個本身就是一個很好的廣告

562
00:35:42,238 --> 00:35:43,978
不管他有沒有skip

563
00:35:43,978 --> 00:35:47,139
有沒有就是跳把你的廣告按掉

564
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:50,020
其實它都是一個很好的投資

565
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:54,482
那其實我們個人是覺得廣告的現在的價錢很亂

566
00:35:54,482 --> 00:36:00,003
然後又好像我們的budget其實沒有很高啦

567
00:36:00,564 --> 00:36:02,325
那所以我們決定不要做

568
00:36:02,325 --> 00:36:04,747
然後就是自己研究自己學

569
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:07,389
然後一開始真的就是很低

570
00:36:07,389 --> 00:36:11,011
然後我們launch之後呢

571
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:13,393
其實他不知道因為廣告是我在負責

572
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:17,456
其實一個月大概有四千塊美金投資

573
00:36:17,456 --> 00:36:19,197
然後最近我們發現說好像沒有

574
00:36:19,197 --> 00:36:21,578
效益沒有那麼好

575
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:22,119
所以我們最近

576
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:24,655
就是不斷地慢慢提高

577
00:36:24,655 --> 00:36:27,015
然後慢慢地去研究

578
00:36:27,015 --> 00:36:30,576
而且你在研究的過程你也可以發現說

579
00:36:30,576 --> 00:36:33,717
欸原來對你的東西有興趣的人是怎麼樣的

580
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:37,858
一開始我們以為我們不會有任何的女生玩家

581
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:40,859
但是在廣告的過程當中你發現

582
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:43,960
欸其實我們有18%都是女生玩家

583
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:49,751
然後所以你可以從你剩下的錢

584
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:51,292
就是你所有生活完了

585
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,652
然後你有一些閒錢

586
00:36:52,652 --> 00:36:55,013
你就全部投資在廣告商

587
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:58,134
然後再越早開始做越好

588
00:36:58,134 --> 00:36:59,295
因為你越早開始做

589
00:36:59,295 --> 00:37:01,955
你就知道你要怎麼target他們

590
00:37:01,955 --> 00:37:04,196
然後他們有興趣的是誰

591
00:37:04,196 --> 00:37:07,457
而且有的廣告商很好是

592
00:37:07,457 --> 00:37:10,418
你可以target你的競爭對手

593
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:11,959
就例如說全家的廣告

594
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:13,920
但是他target的是7-11的

595
00:37:14,705 --> 00:37:16,967
的消費族群

596
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:18,968
那其實這是一個很好的方法

597
00:37:18,968 --> 00:37:20,529
就是你可以去找類似的

598
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,711
或者是說我可以target桌遊

599
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:25,072
因為我們遊戲本身非常的難

600
00:37:25,072 --> 00:37:26,353
那我就會target說

601
00:37:26,353 --> 00:37:28,735
那可能是桌遊的人才會來玩我們

602
00:37:28,735 --> 00:37:31,837
如果是射擊遊戲的可能對我們一點興趣都沒有

603
00:37:31,837 --> 00:37:34,478
那相對你在找實況主的時候

604
00:37:34,478 --> 00:37:36,760
也是要找

605
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,640
如果他只玩射擊遊戲

606
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,882
你就不要期待他會不會你的信

607
00:37:40,882 --> 00:37:41,283
之類的

608
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:43,944
就是從一開始就要開始研究那個

609
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:47,549
那個 對 但是我講回來就是

610
00:37:47,549 --> 00:37:50,872
廣告的預算確實是一條路

611
00:37:50,872 --> 00:37:52,834
但是你可以慢慢增加 慢慢增加

612
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:55,797
從你可以接受的範圍 然後慢慢到很高

613
00:37:55,797 --> 00:38:00,121
但是我們最近調到最高了 可是我們卻決定要停下來

614
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:03,604
先檢查一下是不是真的有那個效益這樣子

615
00:38:03,604 --> 00:38:07,007
不好意思

616
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:07,928
請問一下你剛剛講的廣告

617
00:38:07,928 --> 00:38:08,289
沒關係 沒關係

618
00:38:11,364 --> 00:38:11,704
好 這應該夠了

619
00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:14,726
那我想請問一下你剛剛講的廣告是有針對像是美國區域

620
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:20,290
台灣區域或者是日本區

621
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:24,953
或者是你的廣告就是全球性的

622
00:38:24,953 --> 00:38:30,596
我的廣告一開始我針對所有英語國家

623
00:38:30,596 --> 00:38:32,297
就是說英語的國家

624
00:38:32,297 --> 00:38:34,539
所以才會有香港的人來跟我抱怨說

625
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:36,040
欸怎麼沒有人玩

626
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,181
然後我說可是因為我們不是中文版啊

627
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:41,930
然後當有人跟我說

628
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,511
欸,EU這邊都沒有人玩

629
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:45,792
然後我就會去強化

630
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:48,394
就是可能例如說我可能100塊放美國

631
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:50,375
然後50塊放EU

632
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:51,716
那這個時候我就會調一下

633
00:38:51,716 --> 00:38:53,717
可能這邊就放更多

634
00:38:53,717 --> 00:38:54,617
這邊就先放150,先放個幾天

635
00:38:56,695 --> 00:38:59,756
就拉一些EU的玩家進來

636
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:03,218
然後實況主的影響力非常的大

637
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:08,320
因為我們有一個實況主他是玩Hearthstone

638
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:08,480
盧斯

639
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,060
他是玩盧斯的

640
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,121
然後他住在芬蘭

641
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:13,302
然後他一玩之後我們

642
00:39:13,302 --> 00:39:15,203
我就去看我們的那個Player

643
00:39:15,203 --> 00:39:17,564
然後就想說奇怪我們芬蘭怎麼這麼多人

644
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,885
因為我沒有在芬蘭打任何廣告

645
00:39:19,885 --> 00:39:21,486
然後原來就想到說

646
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:23,207
啊是因為他是芬蘭人

647
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:24,147
所以他的

648
00:39:24,147 --> 00:39:26,208
可能他那邊的國家的人

649
00:39:26,892 --> 00:39:29,193
然後之後我們有一個版主

650
00:39:29,193 --> 00:39:31,755
就是我們discord裡面有一個

651
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:34,076
就是我們討論區的一個版主

652
00:39:34,076 --> 00:39:35,677
他是挪威人

653
00:39:35,677 --> 00:39:37,858
我們就發現有越來越多的挪威人進來

654
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:42,081
然後那些就是我完全沒有去搭廣告的

655
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:44,242
可是也因為他們我就會覺得說

656
00:39:44,242 --> 00:39:45,423
欸那我要照顧他們

657
00:39:45,423 --> 00:39:48,205
所以我就會可能再分個20塊

658
00:39:48,205 --> 00:39:51,326
就是我能夠有的錢我就分個20塊到挪威

659
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:53,888
就算說一天可能只有5個人看到

660
00:39:53,888 --> 00:39:54,989
10個人看到也好這樣

661
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:55,109
所以

662
00:39:57,053 --> 00:39:59,354
如果你是英文的然後又是online的

663
00:39:59,354 --> 00:40:00,594
又是在Steam的話

664
00:40:00,594 --> 00:40:01,814
真的要去考慮

665
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:05,495
你的世界要去考慮全世界的問題對

666
00:40:05,495 --> 00:40:06,455
那你就可以

667
00:40:06,455 --> 00:40:07,435
可能要去分配

668
00:40:07,435 --> 00:40:10,136
那一開始你可能可以先打主力

669
00:40:10,136 --> 00:40:12,857
美國或是你覺得

670
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:14,757
某個國家你特別喜歡

671
00:40:14,757 --> 00:40:16,677
就是它是整個實驗的過程

672
00:40:16,677 --> 00:40:18,378
那隨時都可以微調

673
00:40:18,378 --> 00:40:19,498
就是你的廣告隨時都可以去調整

674
00:40:19,498 --> 00:40:21,658
我要target哪裡

675
00:40:21,658 --> 00:40:22,778
我要target幾歲

676
00:40:22,778 --> 00:40:24,979
我要target男生女生這樣子

677
00:40:26,582 --> 00:40:28,844
那你們在選擇上

678
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:32,166
想怎麼講

679
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:37,770
像是一開始是沒有投預算在芬蘭的

680
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:41,593
那可能一開始可能是美國人比較多

681
00:40:41,593 --> 00:40:44,855
那你們為什麼是選擇就是讓預算平衡一點

682
00:40:44,855 --> 00:40:47,897
而不是變成乾脆就全部都投美國

683
00:40:47,897 --> 00:40:52,900
讓大的跟小的就放棄

684
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,221
我只是好奇

685
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:55,022
懂我的意思嗎

686
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,901
我懂呃

687
00:40:57,901 --> 00:41:00,243
其實一開始真的沒有想那麼多

688
00:41:00,243 --> 00:41:01,264
就是

689
00:41:01,264 --> 00:41:02,304
反正想說

690
00:41:02,304 --> 00:41:05,607
好像有打廣告應該就會有一些

691
00:41:05,607 --> 00:41:07,028
但是你一定會遇到

692
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:08,629
就是隨著你慢慢

693
00:41:08,629 --> 00:41:09,150
遊戲慢慢成長

694
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,611
你一定會遇到不一樣的問題

695
00:41:10,611 --> 00:41:12,852
所以我之後才會開始微調

696
00:41:12,852 --> 00:41:14,934
所以一開始我就沒有去特別想說

697
00:41:14,934 --> 00:41:16,215
我要針對哪個國家

698
00:41:16,895 --> 00:41:19,957
我就想說 反正我就 因為那個時候我也是新手

699
00:41:19,957 --> 00:41:24,419
就是 然後我又沒辦法花那麼多錢去打廣告

700
00:41:24,419 --> 00:41:27,541
所以我想說 那一天六百塊先試看看

701
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:31,082
所以六百塊其實你不能 你不能說

702
00:41:31,082 --> 00:41:32,863
你就算打美國也是打很小的一點

703
00:41:32,863 --> 00:41:35,905
然後你打全世界可能也完全沒有效益

704
00:41:35,905 --> 00:41:37,505
所以我覺得我能夠怎麼做

705
00:41:37,505 --> 00:41:39,766
我當下能夠怎麼做 我就先怎麼做

706
00:41:39,766 --> 00:41:43,408
那其實我覺得這是對於所有獨立開發者一個很好的

707
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:48,132
就是你能夠做多少你就先去做多少

708
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:52,455
然後當你開始有一點成就的成績的時候

709
00:41:52,455 --> 00:41:55,278
你身邊的人自然會就是越來越幫你

710
00:41:55,278 --> 00:41:58,701
那你遇到什麼困難你就再解決

711
00:41:58,701 --> 00:42:02,484
而且線上的支援很多

712
00:42:02,484 --> 00:42:05,726
對我每次遇到廣告問題我就是

713
00:42:05,726 --> 00:42:10,230
線上線Google就是都是Google大神對謝謝

714
00:42:15,011 --> 00:42:18,334
It seems like streamer is more effective than ad.

715
00:42:18,334 --> 00:42:30,446
So you just said that streamer get free game everyday, a bunch of free game everyday.

716
00:42:30,446 --> 00:42:35,530
So how do you stand out for those streamer?

717
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,632
我最近發現就是YouTube已經有點pass了

718
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,270
Twitch是Future

719
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,051
對 因為我一開始

720
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:44,131
他都在開發

721
00:42:44,131 --> 00:42:46,131
那我就要負責就是

722
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:47,732
推廣的部分

723
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,792
然後我就是先蒐集list

724
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:53,413
就是先在Google上面

725
00:42:53,413 --> 00:42:54,653
那有一些網路上

726
00:42:54,653 --> 00:42:56,793
一定會有一些就是已經蒐集好的

727
00:42:56,793 --> 00:42:58,034
然後我又加上我自己的

728
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:00,714
因為每個遊戲不同嘛 所以target有不同

729
00:43:00,714 --> 00:43:02,975
所以我就每天就是蒐集資料

730
00:43:02,975 --> 00:43:04,915
然後蒐集他們的email

731
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:05,235
然後

732
00:43:06,725 --> 00:43:09,147
你就只能email給他們

733
00:43:09,147 --> 00:43:12,350
然後我們找到了幾個不錯的

734
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,212
就是他原本是我們競爭對手

735
00:43:14,212 --> 00:43:17,835
Used to stream Tower7

736
00:43:17,835 --> 00:43:19,236
他原本是我們競爭對手

737
00:43:19,236 --> 00:43:21,598
他們想說我們最近有個新出來的遊戲

738
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:22,779
你要不要玩玩看

739
00:43:22,779 --> 00:43:25,961
那有幾個真的跳過來開始玩我們的

740
00:43:25,961 --> 00:43:28,764
然後但是他們開始玩的時候

741
00:43:28,764 --> 00:43:33,207
你就要注意是不是真的有帶入一些效益或是收益

742
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:33,768
然後我們發現

743
00:43:36,968 --> 00:43:42,111
就是 雖然實況主是真的很強

744
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:43,812
然後真的很有影響力

745
00:43:43,812 --> 00:43:45,153
可是也因為不同的人經營

746
00:43:45,153 --> 00:43:51,157
然後跟不同的平台有不一樣的反應跟效益

747
00:43:51,157 --> 00:43:54,139
所以一開始我們在Alpha跟Beta的時候

748
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:56,060
我就只focus在YouTube

749
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:01,463
因為YouTube真的我要去接觸的實況主已經太多了

750
00:44:01,463 --> 00:44:02,864
然後沒有帶入任何效益

751
00:44:02,864 --> 00:44:03,204
但是我們

752
00:44:04,448 --> 00:44:08,730
Launch了之後就開始有Twitch的人玩

753
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:12,432
然後Twitch就是他們只要玩我們就一定有收益

754
00:44:12,432 --> 00:44:13,812
玩我們就一定有收益

755
00:44:13,812 --> 00:44:16,994
可是也是因為我們遊戲的本質

756
00:44:16,994 --> 00:44:19,655
因為我們遊戲本質是所有

757
00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:21,715
所以是互動性很高的

758
00:44:21,715 --> 00:44:24,317
所以也許你的遊戲會不一樣

759
00:44:24,317 --> 00:44:27,378
就是 但是通常我們自己啦

760
00:44:27,378 --> 00:44:28,698
我們自己到YouTube

761
00:44:29,476 --> 00:44:31,457
我們如果看一個YouTube影片

762
00:44:31,457 --> 00:44:33,159
其實我們自己好像也不會去

763
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:35,100
我們就單純只是看影片而已

764
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,861
可是當我們去Twitch的時候

765
00:44:36,861 --> 00:44:39,783
可能就是真的會去下單

766
00:44:39,783 --> 00:44:42,025
或者是說真的會去買東西

767
00:44:42,025 --> 00:44:43,265
所以

768
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:46,588
如果說你真的要target

769
00:44:46,588 --> 00:44:47,128
實況主的話

770
00:44:47,128 --> 00:44:49,389
可以往Twitch那邊找

771
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:51,551
那YouTube就可以

772
00:44:51,551 --> 00:44:53,312
可能就是放30%或20%

773
00:44:53,312 --> 00:44:55,313
你的心力去

774
00:44:55,313 --> 00:44:55,774
經營就好

775
00:44:59,789 --> 00:45:02,971
we can promote the Twitch streamers very well because

776
00:45:02,971 --> 00:45:06,894
when they go online we can announce through

777
00:45:06,894 --> 00:45:10,796
whatever platform you use, in our case Discord, we can announce that

778
00:45:10,796 --> 00:45:14,478
these guys are going online, go check them out. We can tweet them, we can say, hey

779
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:17,640
this guy's going online, sub sub sub.

780
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,243
It really is sort of a win-win situation. They'll get

781
00:45:22,243 --> 00:45:25,325
followers, they'll get subscriptions, they'll get viewers.

782
00:45:25,651 --> 00:45:28,293
And at the same time, they're playing our game.

783
00:45:28,293 --> 00:45:29,974
So it's a win for everybody.

784
00:45:29,974 --> 00:45:33,757
And then as indie developers, you can make extensions to

785
00:45:33,757 --> 00:45:36,319
even, I mentioned earlier, you can push

786
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,360
engagement even more.

787
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,363
And a lot of streamers just keep requesting that we add

788
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,984
tools to help them.

789
00:45:42,984 --> 00:45:46,146
Because the more that you can engage with

790
00:45:47,524 --> 00:45:53,627
这些Twitch的直播者,观众更想看到,观众更想参与,而不是只看

791
00:45:53,627 --> 00:45:57,889
这就是Twitch的特色,它是在发展的

792
00:45:57,889 --> 00:46:07,753
以前只是一个让你看一个游戏,但是现在是在与游戏和直播者一起参与

793
00:46:07,753 --> 00:46:10,215
这真的帮助了,这比任何你买的广告都好

794
00:46:20,662 --> 00:46:22,963
那我覺得就這樣

795
00:46:22,963 --> 00:46:24,104
如果還有別的問題的話

796
00:46:24,104 --> 00:46:25,084
就是如果你要私下單獨問

797
00:46:25,084 --> 00:46:27,525
就直接等一下來前面跟講者來討論

798
00:46:27,525 --> 00:46:29,866
這樣就OK

799
00:46:29,866 --> 00:46:31,367
那我們最後再掌聲感謝

800
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:31,747
