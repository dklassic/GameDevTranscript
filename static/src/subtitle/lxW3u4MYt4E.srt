1
00:00:00,738 --> 00:00:04,919
那就是很感謝大家今天來參加我們

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:07,280
4月份的獨立遊戲開發者分享會

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,640
那也是很難得這次邀請到

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,641
節奏一聲的其中一位開發者

5
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:16,082
那他其實是2017年的時候就來過台北一次

6
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:20,023
來台北這個去到台北遊戲開發者論壇參展

7
00:00:20,023 --> 00:00:23,023
那這次就是過了幾年之後遊戲終於出了

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,984
然後出了幾個月現在成績很好

9
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:27,625
那就是大家可以跟他揮個手

10
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,585
就應該看得到

11
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:30,125
謝謝各位

12
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:32,322
Thanks for coming.

13
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:40,566
Let's give a round of applause to Hafiz.

14
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:42,367
Thanks for coming, thanks for having me here.

15
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:50,431
Okay, so let's start with just an easy, simple self-intro.

16
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:54,393
Some people may know your game but may not know you at all.

17
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:57,354
Maybe have a self-introduction.

18
00:00:58,635 --> 00:00:59,056
OK, sure.

19
00:00:59,056 --> 00:00:59,996
Hi, everyone.

20
00:00:59,996 --> 00:01:01,237
My name's Hafiz.

21
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:06,081
I'm the co-creator of Rhythm Doctor and A Dance of Fire

22
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:06,742
and Ice.

23
00:01:06,742 --> 00:01:08,043
That means I used to do the coding, the music,

24
00:01:08,043 --> 00:01:10,024
the game design.

25
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:12,426
But these days, I focus more towards the game design

26
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:14,388
and the music.

27
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:14,988
How nice.

28
00:01:14,988 --> 00:01:18,631
And Rhythm Doctor and A Dance of Fire and Ice

29
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:20,093
are one-button rhythm games.

30
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:22,455
So we focus only on rhythm games.

31
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:23,415
OK, so I will translate that.

32
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:30,991
那 Harviz 他是 7thbit games 的開發者之一

33
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:35,213
那他之前有在做的工作有包括就是

34
00:01:35,213 --> 00:01:39,456
音樂 然後寫程式跟遊戲設計都是他親自來做

35
00:01:39,456 --> 00:01:42,237
那他目前這幾年比較 focus 在

36
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:45,099
就是只有在 就是比較聚焦在

37
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:47,140
純粹的這個遊戲設計的這部分

38
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,822
那其他的部分他就是可能交給隊友做這樣子

39
00:01:49,822 --> 00:01:52,543
那他之前有做過一款遊戲叫做

40
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,792
冰與火之舞

41
00:01:56,792 --> 00:02:01,794
然後現在就是兩個月前才上市的那款遊戲

42
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:05,436
叫做《節奏一生》Reason Doctor

43
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:05,576
OK

44
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:14,700
So I guess I will

45
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,042
start with some of your like game development background

46
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:21,163
or like how did you started

47
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:22,924
like jumping into indie development

48
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:30,312
So may I ask about what was your journey going into indie development?

49
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:34,575
Like what was your major in university or like what school did you study?

50
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:35,395
That kind of thing.

51
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:38,097
Can you give a simple background?

52
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:40,539
Actually at university I studied engineering.

53
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:43,661
So I didn't do anything related to game design.

54
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:47,043
I studied engineering at Cambridge in the UK.

55
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:50,125
But actually my journey into game development was kind of like...

56
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,887
kind of parallel to that.

57
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:54,308
So like I started making games

58
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,588
when I was about nine years old.

59
00:02:55,588 --> 00:02:59,130
When I was nine, I found this tool called Game Maker.

60
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,071
So like back then it was called Game Maker,

61
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:02,132
now it's called Game Maker Studio.

62
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:05,154
Back then it was like Game Maker 6, I think.

63
00:03:05,154 --> 00:03:07,455
And I would make games

64
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:09,536
and then I would put them on a floppy disk

65
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:10,897
and then I would come to school

66
00:03:10,897 --> 00:03:13,158
and I'll share them with friends and stuff like that.

67
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:14,539
Like they were really small games,

68
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:18,521
but that was how I first started trying to make games.

69
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:22,222
And then I kind of forgot about it for like 10 years.

70
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:24,443
And then during university, I started

71
00:03:24,443 --> 00:03:28,125
having the feeling that I want to try making one game.

72
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,426
So then that was how I started again.

73
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:29,686
OK.

74
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:39,050
So the process, so the progress kind of like stopped from,

75
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,052
like maybe you're in between your middle school, high school

76
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:43,252
that you just didn't touch it.

77
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,554
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because I think I just got like I just lost interest.

78
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:53,380
Like, you know, when you're when you're a kid, you just like you do whatever is interesting.

79
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,285
And then I was like doing GameMaker for like one or two years, I think.

80
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:59,728
Like every day I would hang on on the forum on the forums.

81
00:03:59,728 --> 00:04:01,931
I was like 10 or 11 years old.

82
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:03,710
like I would hang out on the forums,

83
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,711
I would give reviews to other people's games,

84
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:06,691
I would post my own games.

85
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:08,752
But like, I was really young,

86
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:10,493
so like I didn't really know how to type properly,

87
00:04:10,493 --> 00:04:13,415
and like you could tell I was a kid.

88
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:15,656
So like after like one or two years,

89
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,937
like I just stopped and I just did other stuff for a while.

90
00:04:17,937 --> 00:04:20,578
Actually, there's a very good intro to this

91
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:24,140
because we do have a like 10 year old here

92
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,021
in the background, so.

93
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:26,381
Oh really?

94
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:29,763
Yeah, so I think that's a very good inspiration.

95
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:30,623
So I'll try to like.

96
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:34,316
translate the gist of what you just said

97
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:39,200
就是Havis他在九歲的時候就

98
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,801
那時候就已經有game maker這個套裝軟體

99
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:42,582
然後他就已經

100
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,596
就是大概花了一兩年的時間

101
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:47,097
在用GameMaker做一些小遊戲

102
00:04:47,097 --> 00:04:49,319
然後會去GameMaker的討論版上面

103
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,321
可能跟別人分享自己做了什麼

104
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:53,402
或是說把自己的遊戲做完

105
00:04:53,402 --> 00:04:56,505
然後就用磁片call到學校

106
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,765
然後分享給同學這樣子

107
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,967
然後他可能會去

108
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,929
論壇上面評論別人的遊戲之類的

109
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:05,551
那他是到大學的時候

110
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:08,053
因為去就是讀了這個

111
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:13,177
工程電機相關的科系

112
00:05:13,177 --> 00:05:16,179
然後可能那時候

113
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:18,701
從小學到國中高中那段時間

114
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:21,363
其實他大概就是只有一開始的時候有稍微碰一下Game Maker

115
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,044
然後他到大學的時候

116
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:25,065
然後才重新又開始

117
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:28,347
想要就是

118
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:29,348
做遊戲的這個想法

119
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:30,809
才又重新燃起這樣子

120
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:33,631
然後所以接下來我們就可能繼續問

121
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:34,672
他後來發生什麼事情

122
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:40,938
When you were studying in Cambridge in UK,

123
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:49,066
so did you grew up in UK or did you like go to UK for just for the university?

124
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:51,748
Yeah, no, no. So I grew up here in Malaysia in Malaysia.

125
00:05:51,748 --> 00:05:56,573
OK. And then I only started to go to UK for A-levels, which was when I was about

126
00:05:57,903 --> 00:05:58,804
18 to 19, I guess.

127
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:01,366
Yeah, and then I stayed there for A-levels and then I went to

128
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:03,207
uh, university there.

129
00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:03,547
I see.

130
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:04,648
And then I came back after.

131
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:04,808
I see.

132
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:08,091
So what, what was, what was it like, like, when you was,

133
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:11,013
when you were studying engineering in UK, like,

134
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:14,656
did you find, uh,

135
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:18,600
like, maybe friends or classmates there that are also into

136
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,082
uh, game development?

137
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:21,862
Or like, were you...

138
00:06:21,862 --> 00:06:22,623
Actually, yeah.

139
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:29,761
Yeah, so actually, no, I like, so none of my classmates were making games, but something

140
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:35,204
that's interesting is that over there in Cambridge, there was also something called Cambridge Indies.

141
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:40,047
So it's like an indie meetup, I guess just like this one, but for the location of Cambridge.

142
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:45,170
And there were actually a lot of like pretty popular indie game designers there.

143
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:49,913
So I was able to meet them. People like, do you know Stephen Sausage Troll?

144
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,581
Yeah, I've heard the game.

145
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:54,442
It's a very, very hard puzzle game.

146
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:56,603
He used to be there.

147
00:06:56,603 --> 00:07:01,805
And then I met some other fairly popular people

148
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:03,506
in the indie space.

149
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,986
And that was really inspiring.

150
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:07,007
I only went to one or two meetups.

151
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,188
So I'll finish my lectures, and then I'll go there.

152
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:12,729
And then I would just code for the rest of the day

153
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:13,910
with them in a cafe.

154
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,691
And then sometimes I'd talk to them.

155
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,025
Yeah, it was really nice.

156
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:23,847
So that was like my indie community experience

157
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:25,588
while I was there, I guess.

158
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:27,929
Whereas for my friends in the same course,

159
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:31,511
they didn't do game development, but it

160
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:35,433
was nice to just have them play test my games and stuff like

161
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:35,613
that.

162
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:36,474
Oh, cool.

163
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:40,676
So that was like about 10 years ago, 10-ish?

164
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:41,176
Like maybe 2000?

165
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:41,897
In university?

166
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:42,337
Yeah.

167
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:47,705
我畢業在2015年,大概六年前,六到八年前

168
00:07:47,705 --> 00:07:50,945
哦,所以比十年前還早,很棒

169
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:52,086
對,比十年前還早

170
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:56,907
那我來翻譯一下

171
00:07:56,907 --> 00:08:04,789
就是他在英國劍橋那邊念大學的時候,就是念電機跟工程相關的

172
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:08,749
但是其實他那個時候的朋友還有同學其實並沒有很多人

173
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:09,490
應該是玩...

174
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,935
朋友圈裡面還有同學圈裡面可能就是沒有人在做遊戲開發跟遊戲設計但是

175
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:16,798
那時候在英國的劍橋有

176
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:20,022
就是像我們現在台北這邊很多社群一樣就是他們那邊有一些獨立遊戲開發社群

177
00:08:21,623 --> 00:08:26,408
可能在2010年初期也是有很熱絡的活動

178
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:29,791
他就是在課餘的時間就會去參加

179
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,033
然後從那時候就認識到

180
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:34,035
當時其實有些還蠻有名的開發者

181
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:37,458
包括像他剛剛有提一個例子是那個

182
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,040
就是Steven's Sausage Roll

183
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,401
是一個滾香腸的解謎遊戲 非常的難

184
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:44,186
這邊應該有蠻多人玩過

185
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:46,228
至少沒有玩過的話應該有聽過這款

186
00:08:46,228 --> 00:08:49,692
如果沒有玩過的話可以去Steam上查一下

187
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:54,458
大概三四年前還四五年前

188
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,519
有小紅過一陣子的解謎遊戲

189
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:01,739
下課的時候就是會去跟這些開發者

190
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:02,659
就是他還是學生身分

191
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:04,640
但是他會去跟這些開發者交流

192
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,800
然後去交換一些知識

193
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,820
或是說跟他們學習

194
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,121
那他自己做的一些遊戲成品

195
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:11,901
可能就是回去學校

196
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:14,621
然後就給同學試玩這樣

197
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,942
就是同學雖然沒有參與遊戲開發

198
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:19,742
但是他可以就是做一個局外人的身分

199
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:21,903
就是去幫他測試遊戲

200
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:23,263
或是說看看遊戲做得好不好玩這樣子

201
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:23,403
OK

202
00:09:23,403 --> 00:09:23,523
所以

203
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:37,543
So you graduated in 2015, and when did the IGF thing happen?

204
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:43,319
Okay. So that happened actually during while I was in university.

205
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:43,759
Okay.

206
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,860
So like that was 2014.

207
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,263
So like that was my first time visiting the US actually.

208
00:09:50,263 --> 00:09:55,827
So what happened was like I was working on this game called Rhythm Doctor.

209
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:58,449
So like I would work on it during the summer holidays.

210
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:01,151
So like in Cambridge, like the workload is just way too much.

211
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:04,533
So like I basically can't work on it at all during the term.

212
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:04,633
Right.

213
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:07,435
Like between terms, I can like kind of work on it a little bit.

214
00:10:08,227 --> 00:10:14,197
And then so like I started with an online demo and then like some people liked it

215
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:19,565
and then we kind of slowly grew like added more levels and then let people play and then in

216
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:21,629
2013 at the end of it like

217
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,921
I learned about this thing called the IGF.

218
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:28,665
So like, apparently it's a competition where like anyone can submit their game.

219
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:30,766
And for students back then it was free.

220
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:34,470
I think now it's not free anymore, but back then, so like back then there was

221
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,451
no, like, there was no harm, you know?

222
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:39,615
So, so like, even though I had like, I thought like, you know, there's no way

223
00:10:39,615 --> 00:10:41,596
we're going to get any kind of nomination.

224
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:45,640
Cause like, you know, we don't know like games at all, but like, since it was

225
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,601
free, like I thought, why not, you know?

226
00:10:47,382 --> 00:10:49,143
So I just submitted it.

227
00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:51,704
And then I totally forgot about it,

228
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:55,247
because I was so 100% sure that nothing would come off it.

229
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:58,809
And then two months later in January,

230
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:03,352
I was looking at the game demo, the stats, right?

231
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:06,034
There's something called stat counter.

232
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:07,574
It's like it gives you your stats

233
00:11:07,574 --> 00:11:09,676
for how many page visits your demo gets.

234
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:12,498
And then suddenly there's a huge spike.

235
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:13,258
On which platform?

236
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:14,179
Like 1,000 people came.

237
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:16,420
Do you remember on which platform?

238
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:16,720
1,000 people.

239
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,161
Sorry?

240
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:22,782
Do you remember on what platform that you got your demo account?

241
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,203
Yeah, this was just on Dropbox.

242
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:26,323
Oh, just on Dropbox, okay.

243
00:11:26,323 --> 00:11:29,664
Yeah, yeah. So, like, I put the HTML on the Dropbox.

244
00:11:29,664 --> 00:11:31,785
And then that was my link.

245
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:35,406
So, like, when I submitted to the IGF, like, I just put the Dropbox link.

246
00:11:35,406 --> 00:11:36,146
Right, okay.

247
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:37,987
But it was like a HTML, you know.

248
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:40,628
So, like, you could actually go on it. You don't have to download it.

249
00:11:40,628 --> 00:11:43,408
And then it would play the...

250
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:49,201
Because actually back then Dropbox, so like there was a normal Dropbox where you can share files,

251
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:54,864
but there's also the direct link Dropbox. So like if you change the URL a bit, you can actually

252
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:58,885
treat it like your own website. So you can link directly to the HTML and then it will load as

253
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:03,608
if it's HTML. So I did that. So like on the set counter, I saw the view suddenly go up.

254
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:08,310
So I was like wondering what happened. So then I just searched my game.

255
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,352
on Google and then suddenly I saw it on the list of IGF.

256
00:12:11,352 --> 00:12:14,975
So like, they didn't even give us any email or anything.

257
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,537
Like, I found it after everyone else.

258
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:17,798
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

259
00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:19,259
That we got selected.

260
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:20,079
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

261
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,961
It's really strange.

262
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:26,324
Yeah, that was not my experience with IGF, but, okay.

263
00:12:26,324 --> 00:12:28,186
Okay, let me translate that.

264
00:12:28,186 --> 00:12:31,849
Like, yeah, that was a bit long, but I will try to condense that.

265
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:38,815
就是因為我記得這款遊戲有入圍過IGF學生獎

266
00:12:38,815 --> 00:12:41,198
然後我就跟他確認一下說他的那個

267
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:44,542
就是節奏醫生在什麼時候就是入IGF的

268
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:49,588
那他那時候是2014年IGF的就是學生組就是入圍這樣

269
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:54,310
那他那款遊戲其實就是節奏醫生在開發

270
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,210
應該是開發在大學期間開發一兩年

271
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,332
他那時候2013年的時候還是

272
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:02,113
就是還在劍橋大學念書的時候

273
00:13:02,113 --> 00:13:03,794
那其實那個時候因為

274
00:13:03,794 --> 00:13:06,014
就是既然是全球知名的學府

275
00:13:06,014 --> 00:13:08,315
所以功課也是非常的繁重

276
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:12,017
那其實在這個學期間是沒辦法開發遊戲的

277
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:16,118
那所以他是用就是寒暑假的時間去做

278
00:13:16,118 --> 00:13:16,979
那做一做之後就

279
00:13:18,246 --> 00:13:23,029
也是意外的看到了有一個比賽

280
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:24,029
就是獨立遊戲的競賽

281
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:26,991
叫做IGF Independent Games Festival

282
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:27,611
獨立遊戲節

283
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:30,313
那他是跟每一年的遊戲開發者大會

284
00:13:30,313 --> 00:13:32,754
在舊金山GDC一起舉辦的

285
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:35,916
那他是無意間在2013年的時候看到這個東西

286
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,358
然後就說那我年底的時候還有增稿的時間

287
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:39,839
就投過去看一看

288
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,100
然後後來也就是沒有特別去在意說

289
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,861
到底會不會入圍還是有沒有得獎

290
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:45,822
總之應該也是功課很忙吧

291
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:48,532
投稿之後就忘記了

292
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:49,932
然後結果

293
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:50,993
就是不料隔年的

294
00:13:50,993 --> 00:13:52,254
就是2014年的年初

295
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:53,814
好像一二月的時候就突然間

296
00:13:53,814 --> 00:13:54,475
看到欸

297
00:13:54,475 --> 00:13:55,695
怎麼就入圍了這樣子

298
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:56,696
然後

299
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:57,556
他說那個時候是

300
00:13:57,556 --> 00:14:00,538
遊戲是host在就是

301
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:01,718
Dropbox上面

302
00:14:01,718 --> 00:14:01,938
那

303
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:04,980
Dropbox現在有改版了

304
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,200
那以前比較舊的版本是

305
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,101
你可以在Dropbox上面

306
00:14:08,101 --> 00:14:09,482
就是

307
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:09,502
用

308
00:14:10,595 --> 00:14:11,916
一些超連結的方式

309
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:16,658
可以把它當成像正常的網頁的伺服器使用

310
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:19,280
那他就只是把他的遊戲

311
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,402
就是host在這個Dropbox上面

312
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:24,483
然後結果就是

313
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:27,065
看到了Dropbox那個下載數量突然間暴增

314
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:27,665
他才去查說為什麼

315
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:28,866
然後去Google一下

316
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:30,627
發現怎麼自己入圍了

317
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:33,469
那就是因為這樣入圍之後

318
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:36,570
就才就是第一次去美國

319
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,292
然後第一次去舊金山參加GDC這樣子

320
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:49,398
Okay, so that was your first journey to GD. Did you like go back to the US afterwards?

321
00:14:49,398 --> 00:14:55,123
No, no, so that was like the only time I ever went. Oh, this is the only time you went, okay.

322
00:14:57,015 --> 00:15:05,620
Okay. But it was pretty fun because we got... So for all these games, I worked with my friend from

323
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,823
college. His name is Winston. He was studying in a different university in London. So he's

324
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:13,904
studying at LSE, London School of Economics.

325
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:18,967
And since A-level, like he would like...

326
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:22,691
So back in college, I used to do this thing called like a college newsletter.

327
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:25,675
Right. It's like it's like an editorial thing.

328
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:26,936
So like I used to be the editor.

329
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:29,499
So I would like try to make this a newsletter for the school.

330
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,360
But not game related, right?

331
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,341
Winston was always my guy to help draw anything.

332
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:38,222
So, because he was really good at art.

333
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:40,903
So, whenever I needed an article, he needed some illustrations, I'd ask him,

334
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:43,144
Winston, can you draw something, something.

335
00:15:43,144 --> 00:15:45,225
And he would always draw something really good.

336
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:48,406
So, when I first started making the prototype for Rhythm Doctor,

337
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:53,751
He was the first person I thought, you know, like I thought maybe you can help me

338
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:55,032
do all the graphics because I can't draw.

339
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:58,174
And then, yeah, that's what he did.

340
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:00,896
So then during the IGF, like I went with him and another friend

341
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:06,741
and all three of us went to the to the to the US, to San Francisco for the first time.

342
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:14,047
So the third teammate was from South America, right?

343
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:18,764
Oh, OK. No, no. So at the time of IGF, we didn't meet him yet.

344
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:20,125
Oh, so like this.

345
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,968
So this this third friend was just like he was just a mutual friend.

346
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:25,469
He just wanted to come for fun.

347
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:26,670
OK, so he was helping us.

348
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,092
He was just helping us like

349
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:32,655
start out the booth and like, I see, find food and stuff like that.

350
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:33,375
Yeah. Yeah.

351
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,577
So actually. So the third guy is Yakomo.

352
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,998
He's from South America.

353
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:37,218
Yeah.

354
00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:40,601
It was actually at IGF that we met him.

355
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:43,483
So how it was was if you get nominated for.

356
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,144
an award, they will give you a booth at the IGF.

357
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:50,825
Right. So we were with all the student booths.

358
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:54,606
So there are some people there, like, I didn't know at the time,

359
00:16:54,606 --> 00:16:55,687
but now they're pretty well known.

360
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:58,307
Do you know Mahdi Barami?

361
00:16:58,307 --> 00:17:00,368
He made Angare.

362
00:17:00,368 --> 00:17:02,828
He's an Iranian game developer.

363
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:05,429
So he makes this really beautiful kind of puzzle games.

364
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:07,130
There's one called Angare.

365
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,350
And then there's the other guy.

366
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,551
He was like a few booths down.

367
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:11,791
His name was Albert Shee.

368
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:15,990
he made a museum of simulation technology,

369
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:21,253
which now is called superliminal, right?

370
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:22,914
So,

371
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:28,417
so you, you didn't,

372
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:30,077
you didn't know.

373
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:36,946
I forgot. Yeah. How do I pronounce his name? I kind of,

374
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:40,807
so like it's spelled G I A C O M O,

375
00:17:40,807 --> 00:17:44,067
but it's pronounced with a Y. So it's a Yakomo. Oh, Yakomo. Okay.

376
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:48,088
So you, so like, like, like, like, like, like this is what I think,

377
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:51,109
but like I've not spoken to him in like so many years, right. But, but,

378
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:55,010
but I think that's true. Cause like all, like we talk every day,

379
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,951
but we always talk with only text. So like we never voice or video.

380
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:01,811
So even videoing with you guys, like this is the first time I video in like,

381
00:18:02,572 --> 00:18:05,673
Four years or something. Okay

382
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:12,295
So so so anyway, like like his name is Yakoma. Okay. Oh, yeah, so just to continue the story. Yeah

383
00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:15,677
So we were at we had our own booth

384
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:21,239
At the IGF. So Yakoma was one of the people who just came he was like, oh you have a nice game

385
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:23,740
And he was showing me his game on his phone

386
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,801
He's like if you want to make a mobile part of your game, I can help you

387
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:31,143
So then he showed me this like, you know, super smooth kind of car racing game

388
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:34,016
And I was like, oh, that's cool.

389
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:35,917
So we just exchanged details.

390
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:40,741
And then I didn't really think anything about it until a few months later.

391
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:43,062
He was like, hey, you remember me from IGF?

392
00:18:43,062 --> 00:18:44,864
He just emailed me.

393
00:18:44,864 --> 00:18:46,064
And then I was like, yeah.

394
00:18:46,064 --> 00:18:49,707
And then that's when we started to slowly start to work together.

395
00:18:50,396 --> 00:19:00,946
Okay, so that's interesting. So I didn't quite catch the back story with you and Winston,

396
00:19:00,946 --> 00:19:10,316
because you said Winston was from LSE, which is also a very prestigious school in the UK, right?

397
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:17,193
Yeah. And so how, how, so like, did you guys meet after?

398
00:19:17,193 --> 00:19:22,156
Oh, okay. So, so what happened was like, so we were together before that.

399
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:27,819
We were together during A-levels at our A-level college together.

400
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:32,923
So then it was only after that, then I went to Cambridge and then he went to LSE.

401
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:35,224
So he's also from Malaysia?

402
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:36,305
He's also from Malaysia.

403
00:19:37,046 --> 00:19:41,711
Yes, he is. So I guess that's why I kind of got close to him while I was in A-levels in college,

404
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:47,118
because you see someone from your own country there and then you start to talk to them.

405
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:54,166
And the newsletter thing that you were editing, that was like cross school or like there's...

406
00:19:55,142 --> 00:19:56,563
Oh, no, no. This was during A-level.

407
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,224
So during our A-level college.

408
00:19:58,224 --> 00:20:01,006
I think it's kind of confusing because in the UK,

409
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:03,268
college does not mean university.

410
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,150
Right. So like in the US, college is a university.

411
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,831
Like MIT is a college.

412
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:11,854
But in the UK, like a college is not that like the equivalent of MIT

413
00:20:11,854 --> 00:20:14,756
is like Cambridge and LSE. Those are universities.

414
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:15,777
Right. Whereas.

415
00:20:16,337 --> 00:20:19,020
I'm talking about college, which is like before university.

416
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,964
So after high school, you finish high school, you have to do A-levels for two years.

417
00:20:22,964 --> 00:20:26,387
So that's like a two year little, it's called college.

418
00:20:26,387 --> 00:20:28,869
And then after that, you go to university.

419
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:31,432
So I met Winston in college before that.

420
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:32,713
OK, I see.

421
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:38,659
OK, so let me also try to translate that.

422
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:46,105
就是哈菲斯他在倫敦就學的時間是從就是高中畢業後去那邊

423
00:20:46,105 --> 00:20:52,568
然後就是英國那邊的學制好像是要先念一個叫做這個A level的

424
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:55,109
的算是大學前的學校

425
00:20:55,109 --> 00:21:00,992
然後在他後來才去就是這個劍橋

426
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:02,833
那他在

427
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:10,369
A-Level那邊的時候就是有跟另外一個一樣是從馬來西亞過去的朋友

428
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,371
就是叫Winston Lee

429
00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:15,572
然後在倫敦那邊在念A-Level的時候認識

430
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:19,455
然後他們那時候就是因為有開辦那個

431
00:21:19,455 --> 00:21:22,617
算是他們當時就在學期間的那個

432
00:21:22,617 --> 00:21:28,240
像是學校電子報或是學校的那個學生報之類的那種專欄

433
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,022
那所以他那時候會寫一些文章

434
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:33,624
那他寫文章需要配圖的時候就會請Winston幫忙

435
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,422
所以後來進這個劍橋之後

436
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:40,023
他開始有就是自己私下做一些遊戲

437
00:21:40,023 --> 00:21:41,224
那那個時候他還想說

438
00:21:41,224 --> 00:21:42,525
如果我需要做遊戲的時候

439
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:43,725
有一些美術的幫忙

440
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:45,647
我可能就是回去找之前

441
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:46,827
我那個會畫圖的朋友

442
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:48,248
一起來幫忙這樣子

443
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:51,650
所以那個時候他就跟Winston

444
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,672
一起就做那個節奏一聲的

445
00:21:54,672 --> 00:21:55,973
初始的版本

446
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:58,494
那後來那個版本丟去IGF

447
00:21:58,494 --> 00:22:00,776
有這個入圍的時候呢

448
00:22:00,776 --> 00:22:01,896
他在現場就是有

449
00:22:03,673 --> 00:22:08,517
因為很多的學生的作品都是被圈在同一區這樣

450
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:10,038
那他們就是認識很多人

451
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:12,980
那其中一個人是後來他們也是在IGF現場認識的

452
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,824
是一個南美洲的開發者叫Yakumo

453
00:22:16,824 --> 00:22:23,409
那Yakumo他後來應該就是主要負責接受醫生的程式

454
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:24,990
對那他是現場認識他之後就後來過了一陣子

455
00:22:27,827 --> 00:22:31,368
然後就是GDC跟IGF結束了

456
00:22:31,368 --> 00:22:33,369
然後過了幾個月他才又寫信過來說

457
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:35,530
那要不要來合作做一點東西這樣子

458
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,151
然後後來就說那乾脆就是一起做這個

459
00:22:38,151 --> 00:22:40,252
接受醫生這個專案對

460
00:22:40,252 --> 00:22:41,772
好 剛剛這應該是我應該跳過很多細節

461
00:22:41,772 --> 00:22:44,173
所以就如果大家真的是有忘記的話

462
00:22:44,173 --> 00:22:45,894
可以看錄影

463
00:22:45,894 --> 00:22:46,814
對 因為剛剛其實講很多東西

464
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:54,960
And actually, do you remember that actually I and my friend,

465
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,142
my colleague went to Indiecade like some time ago,

466
00:22:58,142 --> 00:22:59,883
and we met with Yakumo?

467
00:22:59,883 --> 00:23:03,486
I don't know if you remember that.

468
00:23:03,486 --> 00:23:05,127
I think it's also around 2017.

469
00:23:05,127 --> 00:23:08,709
Like maybe, but I wasn't there.

470
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:10,671
So only Yakumo was there.

471
00:23:10,671 --> 00:23:15,834
There was a year where Rhythm, I think Rhythm Doctor also.

472
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:21,122
was nominated in IndieCade.

473
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:23,304
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

474
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:27,327
That was like, I think 2018 maybe? 2017.

475
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:28,607
I think it's 2017.

476
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:36,322
Yeah, yeah. So I wasn't there because, you know, like Malaysia is so far away from the US.

477
00:23:36,322 --> 00:23:40,164
Yeah. So like I already so by that time I was already in Malaysia.

478
00:23:40,164 --> 00:23:46,067
Right. But then Yakomo and our other, so that and our PR person.

479
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:50,469
Well, he's not the artist for Redunza Fire and Ice for the other game.

480
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:54,110
So like Yakomo and Kyle, who's the PR person, they went to Indicate.

481
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,792
And did they meet you? Did they meet your friend?

482
00:23:57,575 --> 00:24:00,996
I think we both I think we had dinner together, actually.

483
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:03,957
Oh, oh, you you actually met Yakumo yourself.

484
00:24:03,957 --> 00:24:04,698
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

485
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:05,198
Oh, cool. OK.

486
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:07,059
Yeah, I actually did know that.

487
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:09,019
Yeah. OK, that's really cool.

488
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:11,020
OK. Yeah.

489
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,862
So I want to indicate that year because

490
00:24:15,862 --> 00:24:18,703
two of Taiwan Indie games

491
00:24:18,703 --> 00:24:21,585
also was nominated, also were nominated.

492
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,405
Oh, nice. Yeah.

493
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:24,786
So one of one of them actually is detention.

494
00:24:26,357 --> 00:24:32,939
Oh yeah, so one of the developer of detention in the background as well

495
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:36,340
Oh it's you, nice to meet you

496
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,981
OK anyway

497
00:24:38,981 --> 00:24:40,081
對就是

498
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:41,321
那個

499
00:24:41,321 --> 00:24:44,242
他的南美洲的那位同事是他

500
00:24:44,242 --> 00:24:46,843
其實很長時間他都是遠距工作都沒有碰面

501
00:24:46,843 --> 00:24:49,044
因為他也是在他們

502
00:24:49,044 --> 00:24:50,444
2014年入圍之後

503
00:24:50,444 --> 00:24:51,344
才

504
00:24:51,344 --> 00:24:53,625
過了幾個月之後才聯繫上然後才就是遠端工作這樣

505
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:53,645
對那

506
00:24:56,782 --> 00:25:01,105
後來2017年這個節奏一生又有入圍另外一個美國的獎項

507
00:25:01,105 --> 00:25:03,627
那一年是我們有去那個

508
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,928
展叫做Indicate

509
00:25:04,928 --> 00:25:06,869
然後剛好那年的時候是台灣有兩個

510
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:14,535
遊戲入圍Indicate一個就是返校然後另外一個是

511
00:25:14,535 --> 00:25:17,017
中文名字叫前往

512
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:19,259
英文名字我已經忘記了但是他是一個

513
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:20,680
就是

514
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,640
密室逃脫遊戲

515
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,122
是有結合VR的密室逃脫遊戲

516
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,403
然後剛好那一年就是很意外的跟

517
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:30,172
就是接受醫生的主人是南美洲主人是碰面這樣子

518
00:25:30,172 --> 00:25:34,433
所以我分開跟他們兩位碰過面然後

519
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:35,673
而且應該是其實在同一年因為2017年

520
00:25:35,673 --> 00:25:38,775
So didn't you come to Taipei in 2017?

521
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:41,335
Yeah, that was TGDF, right?

522
00:25:41,335 --> 00:25:47,638
Yeah, so I met you and Yakumo in the same year.

523
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:53,379
But you probably didn't meet Yakumo in the same year at all.

524
00:25:55,433 --> 00:26:01,275
Like, did you actually meet with Yakumo in 2017?

525
00:26:01,275 --> 00:26:02,356
No, no, no. Not at all.

526
00:26:02,356 --> 00:26:06,638
So the only time I ever met him was 2014.

527
00:26:06,638 --> 00:26:11,119
So I guess you were the person who connected us in 2017.

528
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:11,500
Okay.

529
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,180
And there was no one else.

530
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:17,422
Okay, let's move on to actual game questions.

531
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:19,243
Okay, sure. Yeah.

532
00:26:20,015 --> 00:26:24,139
So I do remember you mentioned, I think it's also like some other event that I met you,

533
00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:28,502
that you mentioned you, I think in South Korea.

534
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:29,623
In South Korea.

535
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:30,243
Yeah, in Korea.

536
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:34,607
And then you were showcasing a dance of ice and fire.

537
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:34,767
Yes.

538
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:40,051
Right. So I was kind of confused, like you were doing Rhythm Doctor,

539
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:43,193
but Rhythm Doctor hasn't come out.

540
00:26:43,193 --> 00:26:44,835
And then you are some of the other games.

541
00:26:44,835 --> 00:26:48,237
So can you discuss a little bit about...

542
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:53,455
the development of like both games like like you yeah

543
00:26:54,975 --> 00:26:58,376
So what happened was, so A Dance of Fire and Ice.

544
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:00,697
OK, I'm going to call it AdoFai.

545
00:27:00,697 --> 00:27:05,879
OK, so like that's A-D-O-F-A-I because that's the acronym for A Dance of Fire and Ice.

546
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:07,439
And it's easier to say.

547
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:08,200
So AdoFai this game.

548
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,360
OK.

549
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,101
So there's Rhythm Doctor and there's AdoFai.

550
00:27:12,101 --> 00:27:19,763
Rhythm Doctor was like I made it in like during university, whereas A Dance of Fire and Ice.

551
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:24,505
So basically after Rhythm Doctor, after I submitted Rhythm Doctor to the IGF.

552
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:28,619
And then they announced it.

553
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:31,840
So I had some other Malaysian game developers contact me

554
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,681
because at the time I didn't know anyone in the Malaysian

555
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:38,342
industry, in the Malaysian indie games industry, or even

556
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:40,583
like games industry in general.

557
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:44,805
So after Rhythm Doctor got the IGF, we had someone from one

558
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:46,666
of the universities contact me.

559
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:50,287
So I went there to meet with a bunch of indie developers and

560
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:53,048
they were like, oh, have you heard of this game jam called

561
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:53,528
Ludum Dare?

562
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:59,437
It's like a 48-hour jam where you make a game in like two days.

563
00:27:59,437 --> 00:28:03,300
So usually it's a weekend, so from Saturday to Sunday, you'll make a game.

564
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,600
So I was like, oh, that's cool.

565
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,144
So during my holidays, there was one Ludum Dare jam at the time.

566
00:28:09,144 --> 00:28:13,567
So I went there, and then that's when I made A Dance of Fire and Ice.

567
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:17,489
So that's why that game started, even though Rhythm Doctor wasn't finished.

568
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:18,530
It's because it was a game jam.

569
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,812
And usually in game jams, you just want to try to make something small.

570
00:28:22,722 --> 00:28:28,729
So after I made that, I released it and then I decided to make a few more levels and then

571
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:33,114
made an online demo. And then people started playing that as well. So now we had two games

572
00:28:33,114 --> 00:28:42,605
kind of in development at the same time. And that was just the case up until both games were released.

573
00:28:45,075 --> 00:28:49,998
So what year was that Ludum Dare? Was it also in 2017 or it's like earlier?

574
00:28:49,998 --> 00:28:55,021
No, no, it was in 2014. So like 2014, in early 2014, like we went to GDC.

575
00:28:55,021 --> 00:28:55,581
Right.

576
00:28:55,581 --> 00:29:02,485
And then after we went to GDC, we came back and then I went back for summer holidays in

577
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:07,588
Malaysia. I met up with other developers there. And then that's when we did the Ludum Dare.

578
00:29:07,588 --> 00:29:08,448
Oh, I see. I see.

579
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,111
那就是Havis的另外一款遊戲

580
00:29:12,111 --> 00:29:14,411
A Dance of Ice and Fire

581
00:29:14,411 --> 00:29:17,132
就是簡稱叫Art of Fire

582
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:19,173
那這款遊戲它是

583
00:29:19,173 --> 00:29:20,954
也是一樣是一個一顆按鍵

584
00:29:20,954 --> 00:29:23,114
就可以玩的節奏遊戲

585
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:27,756
那他那時候是在IGF入圍已經

586
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:29,496
就是整個活動都結束了

587
00:29:29,496 --> 00:29:31,357
然後回到馬來西亞之後

588
00:29:31,357 --> 00:29:36,099
他才開始認識一些就是呃

589
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:36,219
就是

590
00:29:39,253 --> 00:29:42,636
OK, wait, let me clarify one thing.

591
00:29:42,636 --> 00:29:45,878
So you you went back to UK in 2014, right?

592
00:29:45,878 --> 00:29:47,759
Not Malaysia or...

593
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,722
No, no. So I was studying in the UK in Cambridge.

594
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:53,483
I had a four year degree.

595
00:29:53,483 --> 00:29:56,165
So that was like 2012 to 2011, 2015.

596
00:29:56,165 --> 00:30:00,247
Right. But I would also go back to Malaysia for a summer.

597
00:30:00,247 --> 00:30:02,329
Oh, just from time to time. OK.

598
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:02,709
OK, got it.

599
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:06,591
So that was when I met the other Malaysian developers.

600
00:30:06,591 --> 00:30:06,792
Right.

601
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,946
對 那就是他還在學期間

602
00:30:10,946 --> 00:30:15,970
但是他在回馬來西亞的一小段時間

603
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,191
就是那時候剛好有一個

604
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,813
Lundari的這個線上Game Jam

605
00:30:20,813 --> 00:30:23,075
然後他那時候在馬來西亞也開始認識一些

606
00:30:23,075 --> 00:30:25,437
就是因為參與一些活動有人來找他

607
00:30:25,437 --> 00:30:28,119
然後就他認識一些馬來西亞的開發者

608
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,941
然後看到有這個線上Game Jam的社群可以參與

609
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:32,622
然後他就做了這個

610
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:36,185
就是A Dance of Ice and Fire的這個小遊戲

611
00:30:36,185 --> 00:30:37,246
好 然後就

612
00:30:38,788 --> 00:30:40,589
把那個遊戲當作一個免費的Demo

613
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:41,730
就在網路上流傳這樣

614
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,931
所以我記得那個遊戲是

615
00:30:44,931 --> 00:30:48,173
那個遊戲是安卓的Demo嗎?

616
00:30:48,173 --> 00:30:54,035
它是在Ludum Dare後期開始的

617
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:54,936
所以他們給你兩天時間製作一個遊戲

618
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:55,196
然後你需要上傳

619
00:30:55,196 --> 00:30:55,676
通常是網路版

620
00:30:55,676 --> 00:30:58,597
所以你需要一個網路瀏覽器

621
00:30:58,597 --> 00:30:59,698
所以第一版本是網路瀏覽器

622
00:31:07,497 --> 00:31:09,698
The first version was on the browser.

623
00:31:09,698 --> 00:31:09,938
Okay.

624
00:31:09,938 --> 00:31:10,798
Yes, that's right.

625
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,899
And then after that, like, there was still some time during the holidays.

626
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:22,241
So that became my kind of, like, that became the game I was more working on for the next few holidays.

627
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:25,562
So like, because like, you know, that gave me motivation again.

628
00:31:25,562 --> 00:31:25,682
Right.

629
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:27,683
Because there was a new game that like, you know, like...

630
00:31:28,565 --> 00:31:31,966
When you make a new game, it always gives you a lot of new ideas, right?

631
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:37,047
Because like the starting part of a game is usually really easy, where there's all these

632
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:41,848
ideas you can explore. Whereas for Rhythm Doctor, I already made a few levels, so it was like,

633
00:31:41,848 --> 00:31:46,949
it's getting a bit hard to come up with new ideas. So after making A Dance of Fire and Ice,

634
00:31:46,949 --> 00:31:52,350
that motivated me again. So I would make like three worlds, and then I released the Android

635
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:52,710
version.

636
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:58,894
I put it up on like, Congregate and Newgrounds and stuff like that.

637
00:31:58,894 --> 00:32:00,275
That was like, 2014, 2015-ish.

638
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:07,221
And that was the first time I tried selling a game because the Android version was paid.

639
00:32:07,221 --> 00:32:12,626
So that was the first time we actually got any kind of money for a game.

640
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:19,092
So that was really interesting because while I was doing my degree, I never really thought I would.

641
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,571
be an indie game developer.

642
00:32:21,571 --> 00:32:24,512
Like I always had the idea that after I graduate,

643
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:27,633
you know, I do four years of engineering.

644
00:32:27,633 --> 00:32:28,713
Why would I throw that away?

645
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,574
You know, like I've learned so much,

646
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,374
like all these very specific things.

647
00:32:34,374 --> 00:32:36,595
And I wanted like a chance to use it in the industry

648
00:32:36,595 --> 00:32:38,135
and all that stuff.

649
00:32:38,135 --> 00:32:41,576
So like, it never entered my mind.

650
00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:43,316
Like, you know, since I was young,

651
00:32:43,316 --> 00:32:46,397
like indie game development was never anything

652
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,098
I saw myself doing like as a full-time thing.

653
00:32:49,998 --> 00:32:54,061
Because if I did, I probably wouldn't have done engineering.

654
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:59,205
I probably have gone to... I had tried to go to a game design school or something like that.

655
00:32:59,205 --> 00:33:03,749
But because I had no intention to be an indie game developer at all.

656
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:08,773
So that's why I did engineering. And it was only after we started releasing our games while I was

657
00:33:08,773 --> 00:33:12,436
in uni and then people started liking them. And then some people would start paying for them.

658
00:33:12,436 --> 00:33:18,040
I thought maybe I would spend one or two years after university just to make indie games.

659
00:33:18,644 --> 00:33:19,645
然後我會再回到當工程師

660
00:33:19,645 --> 00:33:19,945
但這還沒發生

661
00:33:19,945 --> 00:33:21,165
已經六年了

662
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,206
我現在還在玩印度遊戲

663
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:22,826
OK 這很重要

664
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:23,086
我會詳細跟進

665
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,207
就是

666
00:33:24,207 --> 00:33:24,647
他在做這個

667
00:33:24,647 --> 00:33:29,289
A Dance of Ice and Fire的時候

668
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:30,429
就是那時候是一個小遊戲

669
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:32,290
他一開始只有做網頁版

670
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,991
後來他就是

671
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:57,498
那網頁版他有放到一些就是當時應該算是還都蠻知名的一些網頁遊戲的

672
00:33:57,498 --> 00:33:59,661
就是那種集合網站portal

673
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:02,564
像congregate或是newground直接網站

674
00:34:02,564 --> 00:34:05,867
那他後來也有把這版本做成了

675
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:10,312
就是那當時那個game jam版本然後他做了好像三個不同的世界之後就

676
00:34:12,534 --> 00:34:14,275
做成一個Android上

677
00:34:14,275 --> 00:34:15,756
就是Google Play上可以玩的遊戲

678
00:34:15,756 --> 00:34:17,298
然後他就直接釋出這樣

679
00:34:17,298 --> 00:34:20,060
然後他那時候在Android上面賣的這個版本

680
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:24,144
就直接是有付費很便宜的一個遊戲這樣

681
00:34:24,144 --> 00:34:26,325
那無論他那個遊戲當初賣了多便宜

682
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:30,189
總之是一個他真的有收到錢的作品

683
00:34:30,189 --> 00:34:34,312
那也是因為這樣子他才開始發現說

684
00:34:34,312 --> 00:34:38,816
也許就是做遊戲然後

685
00:34:38,816 --> 00:34:39,737
就是做著一個遊戲然後

686
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:42,249
獲取營收

687
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:45,832
然後以後可能可以把這個當成事業或是生意

688
00:34:45,832 --> 00:34:47,133
就是這個想法才今天出現

689
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:49,255
因為他雖然很早就開始做

690
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:52,137
像用Game Maker做一些小遊戲或是之類的

691
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:53,579
但是

692
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:55,440
他剛剛有講到他覺得如果

693
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,282
如果他在求學過程中

694
00:34:57,282 --> 00:34:59,203
有把

695
00:34:59,203 --> 00:35:02,086
開發遊戲這件事情當成一個很重要的事情去

696
00:35:02,086 --> 00:35:05,309
考量或是說把這東西當成未來可以從事

697
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:08,071
就是

698
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:09,092
算是謀生計的一個

699
00:35:10,182 --> 00:35:11,882
一個行為的話

700
00:35:11,882 --> 00:35:14,763
他應該當時就不會想要去念

701
00:35:14,763 --> 00:35:16,403
電機或工程相關的科系

702
00:35:16,403 --> 00:35:17,763
他應該那時候就會開始去找

703
00:35:17,763 --> 00:35:20,444
就是遊戲科系去念

704
00:35:20,444 --> 00:35:21,584
那就是因為到大學

705
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:22,524
入大學之前為止

706
00:35:22,524 --> 00:35:24,264
他都沒有去認真去思考過這個問題

707
00:35:24,264 --> 00:35:26,585
所以他覺得說

708
00:35:26,585 --> 00:35:28,445
就是可能遊戲是偶爾做一做

709
00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:30,886
然後他還是想要就是當

710
00:35:30,886 --> 00:35:34,006
就是學有專精的這種

711
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,747
就是工程師或者是

712
00:35:36,747 --> 00:35:37,067
就是比較傳統的

713
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:40,129
不管是軟體或是硬體的工程師

714
00:35:40,129 --> 00:35:43,570
然後之後可能就是做正常的工程師的工作這樣

715
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:49,253
對那也是陰錯陽差之下就導致他現在

716
00:35:49,253 --> 00:35:51,894
就是一直在做獨立遊戲

717
00:35:51,894 --> 00:35:54,776
那他剛剛有提到另外一點蠻重要的是說

718
00:35:54,776 --> 00:35:58,717
他在開發節奏醫生的時候

719
00:35:58,717 --> 00:36:02,479
其實到2014 2015年已經算是開發了好幾年

720
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:05,181
然後也做了幾個關卡

721
00:36:05,181 --> 00:36:05,481
那但是

722
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:11,302
當時節奏醫生他要再想出新的關卡跟變出新的玩法花樣

723
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,643
其實會需要花相對更大的心力

724
00:36:13,643 --> 00:36:16,244
那就是其實做起來是蠻累的

725
00:36:16,244 --> 00:36:19,885
那也是因為有那個Game Jam的機會做了另外一款遊戲

726
00:36:19,885 --> 00:36:24,626
才感覺說有一個新東西可以嘗試新的玩法

727
00:36:24,626 --> 00:36:27,167
那就算是可以對自己充個電

728
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,867
那充個電之後可能多一些想法

729
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:30,848
那以後也許會有更多可以

730
00:36:31,892 --> 00:36:35,015
拿來做遊戲設計或是遊戲開發的素材

731
00:36:35,015 --> 00:36:38,738
或者是一些想法之類的

732
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,500
對 那

733
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,461
就

734
00:36:43,461 --> 00:36:46,904
怎麼講 就是

735
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:49,326
像這種就是用Game Jam

736
00:36:49,326 --> 00:36:53,089
來稍微充個電 然後稍微

737
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:53,349
重新

738
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:58,411
看一些或是嘗試一些自己正常的專案

739
00:36:58,411 --> 00:36:59,352
或是比較大的專案

740
00:36:59,352 --> 00:37:00,532
不會去嘗試一些事情

741
00:37:00,532 --> 00:37:04,294
其實是我們在推Game Jam類活動的時候

742
00:37:04,294 --> 00:37:05,475
還蠻主打的一個點

743
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:08,156
那如果有人這邊以後想要參加Game Jam的話

744
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:08,916
就是可以關注

745
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:10,297
因為台灣現在其實Game Jam也很多

746
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:12,038
那我想在座這邊應該有蠻多人

747
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:14,639
也是至少都看過或是參與過這樣子

748
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,620
那我這邊就不太多做介紹

749
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,340
那如果有問題的話

750
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:17,741
等一下可以再繼續問

751
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:25,112
Okay, so let's get into some of the game design questions

752
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:26,953
that I had.

753
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:33,897
So you mentioned that you want to try something new

754
00:37:33,897 --> 00:37:36,659
in A Dance of Ice and Fire, right?

755
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:40,521
And that's sort of like,

756
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:44,944
kind of like revitalized your ideas

757
00:37:44,944 --> 00:37:47,885
and your passion about game design at the time.

758
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:52,220
But interestingly, the Rhythm Doctor and Adophi,

759
00:37:52,220 --> 00:38:01,610
both are rhythm games that can only be played with one button.

760
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,673
So why did you hold on to that constraint?

761
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:08,196
That's an interesting question.

762
00:38:08,196 --> 00:38:10,258
Actually, if you ask me, do I ever want to?

763
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,451
Do I ever want to make other genres of games?

764
00:38:13,451 --> 00:38:18,413
I don't think I have that much interest, but it's not only

765
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:21,954
my interest, but also because I don't think I'll be good

766
00:38:21,954 --> 00:38:26,636
enough to try making another kind of genre of game.

767
00:38:26,636 --> 00:38:30,738
Because I guess one of the reasons why I like to do rhythm

768
00:38:30,738 --> 00:38:31,458
kind of games, right?

769
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:33,359
Because I have a music background.

770
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,181
So I know that it's a lot easier to find ideas that are new.

771
00:38:39,467 --> 00:38:44,670
for me compared to other people if I try to work in this genre.

772
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:51,254
So that's one of the reasons why for me, I wanted to stick to rhythm.

773
00:38:51,254 --> 00:38:58,698
But also because I have a natural interest in music and rhythm and exploring that stuff.

774
00:38:58,698 --> 00:39:02,100
So even if I wasn't making games, I was still composing stuff.

775
00:39:03,316 --> 00:39:07,639
playing the piano, playing the guitar and the violin and all that kind of stuff.

776
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:14,964
So if I make games and I can actually, I have a chance to use all that stuff

777
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:18,127
in the game itself, that's even more motivating for me.

778
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:25,647
So that's, I think, a big reason why I really like to make games in this specific genre.

779
00:39:25,647 --> 00:39:30,032
Because I think I might be better at it than other genres, but also because

780
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:33,396
I just have an interest in this specific kind of field.

781
00:39:34,277 --> 00:39:38,719
Even though the games I play, I don't really play many rhythm games, actually.

782
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:45,402
So the games I love to play are like twitchy platformer kind of games, like Celeste, Super Hexagon,

783
00:39:45,402 --> 00:39:46,943
Velocibox, one of my friend's games.

784
00:39:46,943 --> 00:39:48,964
It's kind of like Super Hexagon as well.

785
00:39:50,048 --> 00:39:52,170
That's usually the kind of games I like.

786
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:56,994
And the reason why I like it is because it's very relaxing to me

787
00:39:56,994 --> 00:40:00,697
to just kind of memorize inputs and not think about anything.

788
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:06,481
So as a way to de-stress, that's usually my kind of game that I like to play.

789
00:40:06,481 --> 00:40:08,803
But it's not rhythm games.

790
00:40:08,803 --> 00:40:17,329
Part of the reason why I think is because of the design of rhythm games these days,

791
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:18,851
the skill ceiling is really high.

792
00:40:19,775 --> 00:40:22,617
And usually the more interesting parts of game design

793
00:40:22,617 --> 00:40:26,281
is only at the higher levels of play.

794
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:32,226
Whereas if you're not good at finger dexterity like I am,

795
00:40:32,226 --> 00:40:35,429
then you'll be stuck at a lower level where things are not

796
00:40:35,429 --> 00:40:37,170
as interesting.

797
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:40,573
So that was also why the games that I tried to design,

798
00:40:40,573 --> 00:40:44,217
I tried to make them easy in terms of the dexterity.

799
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:48,244
but complicated in terms of the theory, because that's the kind of thing I like, right?

800
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:53,326
That's the kind of thing I enjoy more, like the kind of musical complexity.

801
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:58,729
But I don't want to have to try to train my finger dexterity just in order to experience that kind of

802
00:40:58,729 --> 00:41:05,452
complexity in the rhythm. So that's like, if you ask me why our games are rhythm games,

803
00:41:05,452 --> 00:41:08,873
and why our games are one button games, and why our games are...

804
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:15,309
kind of simple in terms of not requiring too much finger

805
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:15,989
dexterity.

806
00:41:15,989 --> 00:41:19,930
So that's why I write, because that's what I like.

807
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:22,891
I want to explore the more complicated parts

808
00:41:22,891 --> 00:41:29,634
without having to get good at the dexterity and my skills.

809
00:41:29,634 --> 00:41:31,995
OK, that really makes a lot of sense.

810
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:34,676
And I think it's also very important.

811
00:41:34,676 --> 00:41:36,457
I will try to translate that.

812
00:41:36,457 --> 00:41:37,097
So.

813
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:43,473
就是我剛剛問的問題是想要問說就是

814
00:41:43,473 --> 00:41:45,874
他的兩款遊戲現在都是

815
00:41:45,874 --> 00:41:48,675
不僅都是

816
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:49,576
節奏遊戲

817
00:41:49,576 --> 00:41:50,716
而且都是

818
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,138
只用一顆鍵就可以操作的節奏遊戲

819
00:41:53,138 --> 00:41:57,780
到底是怎樣的因素影響他去連續做兩款遊戲都是這個風格

820
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,701
那

821
00:41:59,701 --> 00:42:02,002
第一個部分是跟就是節奏遊戲有關

822
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:02,883
就是說為什麼只挑節奏遊戲

823
00:42:02,883 --> 00:42:02,903
那

824
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,802
他說他其實他本人自己

825
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:09,404
甚至也沒有玩太多別的類型的遊戲

826
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:10,585
甚至節奏就是現在比較

827
00:42:10,585 --> 00:42:12,607
市面上比較流行的音樂節奏遊戲

828
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,248
他其實也沒有玩很多

829
00:42:14,248 --> 00:42:17,170
但是他自己有音樂背景

830
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:22,475
那所以他覺得用他自己熟悉的

831
00:42:22,475 --> 00:42:24,116
就是有專長的東西

832
00:42:24,116 --> 00:42:26,158
去發想一些比較新的內容

833
00:42:26,158 --> 00:42:27,299
應該是相對來講

834
00:42:27,299 --> 00:42:29,160
比去發想一些他不熟悉的內容

835
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,022
要來得容易

836
00:42:31,022 --> 00:42:32,903
那所以他才會就是一直想要

837
00:42:33,782 --> 00:42:38,883
就是開發跟節奏遊戲相關的類型

838
00:42:38,883 --> 00:42:40,284
那另外一個方面是說

839
00:42:40,284 --> 00:42:43,584
他的這個玩法上為什麼要限制說

840
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:46,805
就是連續兩款都是只有一顆鍵

841
00:42:46,805 --> 00:42:48,146
而不是說像一些音樂遊戲

842
00:42:48,146 --> 00:42:51,146
他可能是操作上比較複雜

843
00:42:51,146 --> 00:42:54,607
那他的感覺是

844
00:42:54,607 --> 00:42:57,428
因為現在蠻多音樂遊戲

845
00:42:57,428 --> 00:43:01,569
你可能在這個關卡

846
00:43:01,569 --> 00:43:02,789
就是譬如說某一個譜面是

847
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:04,960
譬如說什麼連音特別多啊

848
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,681
還是說他可能就是這個這首音樂是

849
00:43:07,681 --> 00:43:10,282
打特定的節奏或是說走特定的風格

850
00:43:10,282 --> 00:43:14,843
但是這個concept這個概念可能

851
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:17,004
對玩家來說是

852
00:43:17,004 --> 00:43:19,165
大腦容易理解但是他

853
00:43:19,165 --> 00:43:23,726
手指就是不夠快就是你可能要練很久才能練到那個手速或是說那個手的

854
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:26,948
的那個某一些音符

855
00:43:26,948 --> 00:43:28,449
或是某一些節奏的pattern

856
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:30,070
某些節奏的模式

857
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,450
你一定要反覆的去練習

858
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,831
然後把你的這個手練到很靈活

859
00:43:33,831 --> 00:43:34,792
才有辦法

860
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:36,273
就用肌肉記憶之類的概念

861
00:43:36,273 --> 00:43:38,273
才能去玩一些很高端的關卡

862
00:43:38,273 --> 00:43:40,735
那些遊戲裡面很多有趣的關卡

863
00:43:40,735 --> 00:43:42,755
他也許其實都是

864
00:43:42,755 --> 00:43:45,036
普遍難度都相當高的

865
00:43:45,036 --> 00:43:46,837
那反過來說

866
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:48,778
他比較希望可以做一款節奏遊戲是

867
00:43:50,174 --> 00:43:51,315
操作很簡單

868
00:43:51,315 --> 00:43:54,097
就是你不需要去熟悉很多那種

869
00:43:54,097 --> 00:43:56,419
譬如說什麼吉他英雄的指法

870
00:43:56,419 --> 00:43:59,361
還是說什麼

871
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:01,823
呃某些這個節奏遊戲

872
00:44:01,823 --> 00:44:02,624
或是打鼓遊戲

873
00:44:02,624 --> 00:44:04,285
有那種很複雜的

874
00:44:04,285 --> 00:44:06,627
就是呃

875
00:44:06,627 --> 00:44:08,588
有好幾個不同的那個骨面

876
00:44:08,588 --> 00:44:09,849
都要去記

877
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:12,131
那就是說只用一顆按鍵

878
00:44:12,131 --> 00:44:14,453
然後你就是一隻手指一起去戳他

879
00:44:14,453 --> 00:44:16,334
就可以玩的遊戲

880
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:17,936
那但是在這之上

881
00:44:17,936 --> 00:44:18,296
他可以

882
00:44:19,497 --> 00:44:24,638
用這麼簡單的操作模式去加入一些相對

883
00:44:24,638 --> 00:44:26,918
就是說

884
00:44:26,918 --> 00:44:29,858
你大腦會需要花一點時間才能理解的概念

885
00:44:29,858 --> 00:44:30,859
譬如說

886
00:44:30,859 --> 00:44:34,819
特定形式的節奏像如果有玩過節奏醫生的人應該知道就是說他

887
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:37,620
其實在每一個大關或是說每一個

888
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,741
角色出來跟你介紹他的背景然後就是你要去

889
00:44:41,741 --> 00:44:45,121
幫他的時候其實你

890
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:46,901
那個那個按法就是你如果有get到的話

891
00:44:48,344 --> 00:44:48,905
你就會按

892
00:44:48,905 --> 00:44:50,187
如果你沒有get到的話

893
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,849
就是跟你手速多快

894
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:53,412
其實沒什麼關聯

895
00:44:53,412 --> 00:44:54,213
像這樣子的東西

896
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:55,234
是他比較喜歡做的

897
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,997
所以他才會連續做兩款遊戲

898
00:44:56,997 --> 00:44:57,998
都是像這樣子的風格

899
00:45:00,355 --> 00:45:07,480
OK, so I want to switch gear to two other type of questions,

900
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,463
because I know you might if I add something more to what I was talking about earlier.

901
00:45:12,463 --> 00:45:15,825
Yeah. So, like, I just want to say that, like,

902
00:45:15,825 --> 00:45:21,088
nothing, nothing I personally do, like, I don't think it matches.

903
00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:23,750
I don't think it's as good as what anyone else does.

904
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,970
And what I mean by that is, like,

905
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:26,691
some people, they say, like, they play Rhythm Doctor.

906
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:35,454
And they say, wow, this is the first game that focus on music theory or the first game that teach the first game that's actually about rhythm or something like that.

907
00:45:35,454 --> 00:45:36,294
Right.

908
00:45:36,294 --> 00:45:48,497
But actually, all the kind of stuff that I like to focus on, like fundamentals of rhythm theory, maybe like swing music or irregular time signatures or interesting rhythms, all that stuff exists in other games.

909
00:45:49,738 --> 00:45:53,700
You know, like the biggest rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution or

910
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,741
anything that React does, like once you go up to the high levels,

911
00:45:57,741 --> 00:46:03,264
like all that stuff is there. The only difference is that

912
00:46:03,264 --> 00:46:06,725
because I eliminate most of the

913
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:10,147
dexterity requirements, people who are not that good

914
00:46:10,147 --> 00:46:16,250
at rhythm games can experience that kind of high level of rhythm without

915
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,231
without having to get very good at the game first.

916
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:22,872
And that's why these people say, like, oh, this is the first

917
00:46:22,872 --> 00:46:25,153
the first music rhythm theory game or whatever.

918
00:46:25,153 --> 00:46:27,494
But it's not. It's just because it's just because, like,

919
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:29,635
it's just made more accessible to these people.

920
00:46:29,635 --> 00:46:31,655
And the people who say that are usually people who are

921
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:35,977
who don't really have much experience in the big rhythm games.

922
00:46:35,977 --> 00:46:38,097
And I think that's similar to

923
00:46:38,097 --> 00:46:42,219
similar to like why, like similar to why I make rhythm games,

924
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:44,860
because, like, I know I'm not better than anyone,

925
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,500
like probably everyone in this room, right?

926
00:46:46,705 --> 00:46:53,506
would have, like maybe some of you have like gone to game design school.

927
00:46:53,506 --> 00:47:00,028
So, you actually know the fundamentals of game design much better than me, because like I

928
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:07,429
haven't actually studied a lot of these things. So, like it's something I want to get better at,

929
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:12,790
but it's the same kind of reasoning, right? So, I'm like everything I do is not really like...

930
00:47:13,465 --> 00:47:16,126
anything better than anyone else.

931
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:18,547
I'm just kind of sticking to the stuff I know.

932
00:47:18,547 --> 00:47:23,269
And sometimes I kind of make stuff that's inaccessible

933
00:47:23,269 --> 00:47:26,430
because inaccessible to normal players,

934
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:30,492
more accessible to those players.

935
00:47:30,492 --> 00:47:33,873
So sometimes it might seem to them

936
00:47:33,873 --> 00:47:36,814
like our games are innovative in some way,

937
00:47:36,814 --> 00:47:40,015
but really it's just like a mishmash of...

938
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:44,614
of influences and inspirations

939
00:47:44,614 --> 00:47:48,115
made into something that's more accessible to

940
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,436
the average player, I think.

941
00:47:50,436 --> 00:47:51,557
If that makes sense.

942
00:47:51,557 --> 00:47:55,698
I think that's a very humble way of putting it.

943
00:47:55,698 --> 00:47:58,359
But yeah, I get it. I get what you're saying.

944
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:01,601
So let me also translate that part quickly.

945
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:04,362
He just said that

946
00:48:10,185 --> 00:48:14,766
很多知名的音樂遊戲

947
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:15,947
包括他剛剛也有舉例

948
00:48:15,947 --> 00:48:17,667
就是像雷亞的音樂遊戲

949
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:19,588
就是這種音樂遊戲

950
00:48:19,588 --> 00:48:22,048
它裡面就是各種樂曲

951
00:48:22,048 --> 00:48:24,089
也是會有很多

952
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:27,090
就是跟音樂相關的背景知識或是技巧

953
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:28,550
或是說有些背景資訊

954
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:29,710
玩家不一定會知道

955
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,651
但是你玩到高端的玩家

956
00:48:31,651 --> 00:48:35,252
你一定是會體驗到那些相關的東西

957
00:48:35,252 --> 00:48:36,832
但是大部分的這些音樂遊戲會讓

958
00:48:40,746 --> 00:48:45,527
沒有辦法練起來的那些比較普通的玩家

959
00:48:45,527 --> 00:48:48,608
他就無法體會到就是所謂

960
00:48:48,608 --> 00:48:52,709
就是音樂跟節奏那些有趣的面向

961
00:48:52,709 --> 00:48:55,590
可能就是沒有辦法去體會到

962
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:59,851
那所以他常常聽到有一些

963
00:48:59,851 --> 00:49:01,391
現在的玩家可能會說

964
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:02,932
他們的兩款作品都是讓

965
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:08,003
就是那些玩家都會說你這個遊戲讓我耳目一新啊

966
00:49:08,003 --> 00:49:09,884
就是我從來沒有看過節奏遊戲這樣做

967
00:49:09,884 --> 00:49:11,425
或是說有很多節奏遊戲

968
00:49:11,425 --> 00:49:14,586
就是好像

969
00:49:14,586 --> 00:49:15,486
在

970
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:20,929
在展現跟節奏相關的概念上面都不如這款遊戲那種感覺

971
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:24,870
但是他強調是說其實並不是其他遊戲都沒有這些內容而是

972
00:49:27,307 --> 00:49:32,430
他想要做的遊戲比較偏向就是可以用很簡單的操作

973
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:39,134
就能讓玩家體驗到那些相對比較

974
00:49:39,134 --> 00:49:41,595
難或是比較進階的一些概念

975
00:49:41,595 --> 00:49:43,236
那

976
00:49:43,236 --> 00:49:44,036
你也就是

977
00:49:46,143 --> 00:49:48,083
不需要是一個專業的音樂遊戲玩家

978
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:49,744
你也可以知道你可以體會到那些

979
00:49:49,744 --> 00:49:52,904
譬如說什麼就是不規則的節拍啊

980
00:49:52,904 --> 00:49:55,025
或是說一些比較不常見的節拍的那些概念

981
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:55,965
你以前可能

982
00:49:55,965 --> 00:49:58,225
可能也許以前高中國中音樂課有上過

983
00:49:58,225 --> 00:50:00,145
但是馬上就還給老師那些東西

984
00:50:00,145 --> 00:50:03,246
就是你反而玩這款遊戲之後可以體驗到那些內容

985
00:50:03,246 --> 00:50:05,246
那也不會操作很複雜

986
00:50:05,246 --> 00:50:07,527
對那他自己

987
00:50:07,527 --> 00:50:10,467
其實並沒有去學過很多就是遊戲設計遊戲開發相關的知識

988
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:10,487
那

989
00:50:13,298 --> 00:50:14,499
他所有東西都是自學

990
00:50:14,499 --> 00:50:16,881
所以他寧可就是用他自己所知自己所學

991
00:50:16,881 --> 00:50:19,463
就是盡量把自己知道的東西簡化

992
00:50:19,463 --> 00:50:25,187
然後推給算是讓他的這個遊戲的可被接受的程度

993
00:50:25,187 --> 00:50:28,850
就是在一般玩家間可被接受的程度就是更上升

994
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:30,871
那所以才會有那麼多玩家覺得說

995
00:50:30,871 --> 00:50:34,354
好像這些東西都只有在你這款節奏遊戲裡看過

996
00:50:34,354 --> 00:50:35,555
那其實是因為那些玩家

997
00:50:35,555 --> 00:50:38,858
其實他們當初可能是有嘗試過一些比較難的節奏遊戲

998
00:50:38,858 --> 00:50:40,959
但是就玩了一下就被擊退了

999
00:50:40,959 --> 00:50:42,240
所以也不會體驗到那些

1000
00:50:42,961 --> 00:50:45,222
比較難的幾個遊戲到底有哪些美好處

1001
00:50:45,222 --> 00:50:45,403
OK

1002
00:50:45,403 --> 00:50:54,148
So I want to switch gear to other side of

1003
00:50:54,148 --> 00:50:59,551
like some of my remaining questions

1004
00:50:59,551 --> 00:51:02,733
So I noticed that in the game there is a lot of

1005
00:51:04,782 --> 00:51:08,426
Mandarin and Chinese references.

1006
00:51:08,426 --> 00:51:11,751
So I wonder if that is your idea,

1007
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:13,373
or if that's Winston's idea.

1008
00:51:13,373 --> 00:51:18,819
How did you make, so there are even music

1009
00:51:18,819 --> 00:51:21,102
with Mandarin lyrics, right?

1010
00:51:21,102 --> 00:51:23,025
So how did you make that happen?

1011
00:51:24,895 --> 00:51:28,438
Okay, so first of all, have you been to Malaysia before?

1012
00:51:28,438 --> 00:51:30,981
So like Malaysia has kind of a big...

1013
00:51:30,981 --> 00:51:34,364
Like Malaysia has a big Chinese influence already in itself, right?

1014
00:51:34,364 --> 00:51:36,286
A big part of the population is Chinese.

1015
00:51:36,286 --> 00:51:38,928
Like I'm part Chinese, Winston's Malaysian Chinese.

1016
00:51:38,928 --> 00:51:44,433
So like we already have that kind of culture in...

1017
00:51:44,433 --> 00:51:48,898
We have the kind of culture in our country already.

1018
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:49,758
So part of it is...

1019
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:54,186
So how we work like me and Winston, right?

1020
00:51:54,186 --> 00:51:56,890
I would ask him to draw like I would never give him like an

1021
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,812
actual like something to draw.

1022
00:51:58,812 --> 00:52:01,155
I would just give him the mechanic like we need a character

1023
00:52:01,155 --> 00:52:05,981
or we need a heart and then he would just do whatever he wants.

1024
00:52:05,981 --> 00:52:08,705
So like a lot of the stuff that a lot of the stuff with like

1025
00:52:08,705 --> 00:52:09,586
Chinese influence.

1026
00:52:10,922 --> 00:52:16,344
comes from him, he just decides to take that character into

1027
00:52:16,344 --> 00:52:17,744
this kind of culture.

1028
00:52:17,744 --> 00:52:22,186
And then I would see it, and then I would get inspired by it,

1029
00:52:22,186 --> 00:52:28,188
and I would kind of make something that goes more towards

1030
00:52:28,188 --> 00:52:29,068
that kind of culture.

1031
00:52:29,068 --> 00:52:31,729
But then if you're asking for the music specifically.

1032
00:52:34,491 --> 00:52:40,197
Like, I guess the first boss level, it uses an Erhu and a Guzheng.

1033
00:52:40,197 --> 00:52:43,060
These are like Chinese instruments.

1034
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:49,708
That was kind of like an interesting coincidence, I guess, because I was listening to this.

1035
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:53,111
I think he's a Taiwanese musician.

1036
00:52:53,111 --> 00:52:56,095
Oh, what's his name?

1037
00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:01,237
Shanghai Restoration Project.

1038
00:53:01,237 --> 00:53:02,499
Maybe he's from China, actually.

1039
00:53:02,499 --> 00:53:06,267
Yeah, so he's an artist called Shanghai Restoration Project.

1040
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:09,533
He likes to combine Chinese instruments with hip-hop.

1041
00:53:10,642 --> 00:53:12,863
And I was really into that kind of music at the time.

1042
00:53:12,863 --> 00:53:15,125
So I thought, hey, maybe let's try something like that.

1043
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:18,188
And then we had like for that boss level,

1044
00:53:18,188 --> 00:53:21,070
there's a mechanic where you have to count to seven,

1045
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,732
you have to press on the seventh beat,

1046
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:24,613
but the song itself will start to stutter.

1047
00:53:24,613 --> 00:53:26,255
So it has like glitch effects.

1048
00:53:26,255 --> 00:53:26,775
Yeah.

1049
00:53:26,775 --> 00:53:29,718
And that kind of thing felt really...

1050
00:53:30,928 --> 00:53:36,752
felt really fitting with this kind of genre, like hip hop kind of Chinese, because if you take hip

1051
00:53:36,752 --> 00:53:41,955
hop Chinese music and then you start to study it, it sounds more cool to me. So I was like,

1052
00:53:41,955 --> 00:53:49,659
okay, yeah, so let's go with that. So basically, a lot of this kind of influence has been

1053
00:53:51,388 --> 00:53:58,517
I guess, influenced by our backgrounds as well, the stuff we listen to, how it's like in Malaysia.

1054
00:53:58,517 --> 00:54:04,886
And sometimes, like, sometimes these little pockets of culture just appear here and there, you know.

1055
00:54:05,627 --> 00:54:08,547
because of our backgrounds.

1056
00:54:08,547 --> 00:54:11,268
It's not a very explicit choice.

1057
00:54:11,268 --> 00:54:15,909
It's not like we want to appeal to the Chinese market, so we'll make this.

1058
00:54:15,909 --> 00:54:19,010
But it's more like it just happens naturally.

1059
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:23,211
And then what happened was we also got a Chinese publisher

1060
00:54:23,211 --> 00:54:24,131
after a few years.

1061
00:54:24,131 --> 00:54:26,952
So they helped us.

1062
00:54:26,952 --> 00:54:28,492
So they kind of made us.

1063
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:33,011
focus more on stuff like translation.

1064
00:54:33,011 --> 00:54:37,493
So we also redid our songs in Mandarin because of them.

1065
00:54:37,493 --> 00:54:41,534
So they funded this kind of stuff for us.

1066
00:54:41,534 --> 00:54:43,274
So we're like, okay, sure, if they want to.

1067
00:54:43,274 --> 00:54:45,495
So we're happy to do that.

1068
00:54:46,346 --> 00:54:52,350
And because a lot of people in Malaysia are Chinese, it's easy to find Chinese singers

1069
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,592
and Chinese speakers. I see.

1070
00:54:54,592 --> 00:55:02,297
Actually, the interesting part was, so the way they count in Rhythm Doctor is

1071
00:55:02,297 --> 00:55:06,239
and it's always in Mandarin.

1072
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,381
I don't really know.

1073
00:55:08,381 --> 00:55:13,143
I can't remember why, but I think it was because one of my friends who was the voice for the

1074
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:19,226
nurse, she was Malaysian Chinese, and we thought it would be more fun if she just tries to

1075
00:55:19,226 --> 00:55:21,067
speak in Chinese.

1076
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:24,909
So that was the start of the Chinese influence, I guess.

1077
00:55:24,909 --> 00:55:27,291
And then it started to seep in other ways.

1078
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:30,852
I think some things inspire other things, which inspire more things.

1079
00:55:30,852 --> 00:55:31,052
Yeah.

1080
00:55:31,052 --> 00:55:33,614
I think that's a very interesting story.

1081
00:55:34,614 --> 00:55:43,860
Nothing really was deliberately made, but it's just like the background culture just influence and like just bleed into your game, right?

1082
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:50,985
Yeah, yeah. So like I think our game is suitable for that because you know the story is kind of crazy.

1083
00:55:50,985 --> 00:55:56,068
It's got like all kinds of patients, so it doesn't really matter what kind of direction the game goes in.

1084
00:55:56,557 --> 00:56:00,141
So I can do like one day I feel like making hip hop, one day I feel like making lo-fi.

1085
00:56:00,141 --> 00:56:05,327
It's okay because you know it's a kind of a variety game where like every patient is different.

1086
00:56:05,327 --> 00:56:09,451
I don't think that kind of thing would work if you have a very focused kind of game, right?

1087
00:56:09,451 --> 00:56:09,952
Right.

1088
00:56:09,952 --> 00:56:14,918
So it's just for us that it's easy to do because we keep our constraints kind of like.

1089
00:56:15,899 --> 00:56:21,403
We keep it focused on the only thing that connects all of these

1090
00:56:21,403 --> 00:56:26,968
kind of different cultures in the game is the music.

1091
00:56:26,968 --> 00:56:29,110
Right. So that's where we start.

1092
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:34,034
So if the music theory gameplay is kind of fixed, then everything

1093
00:56:34,034 --> 00:56:35,796
else can be more flexible around.

1094
00:56:35,796 --> 00:56:39,479
Right. Whereas I know some games that are not game design focused.

1095
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,921
So they focus on the aesthetics first.

1096
00:56:41,701 --> 00:56:46,244
所以我想你會想要專注在你的美學上

1097
00:56:46,244 --> 00:56:48,805
你不想接受任何影響而只會把美學放進去

1098
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:49,906
而對於SOS就沒問題了

1099
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:53,008
因為那就是我們要做的遊戲

1100
00:56:53,008 --> 00:56:54,609
OK,這合理

1101
00:56:54,609 --> 00:56:58,511
那剛這段我主要是想要問說就是

1102
00:56:58,511 --> 00:57:00,673
就是因為這款就是節奏醫生

1103
00:57:00,673 --> 00:57:03,634
它裡面就是有其實有很多華文的元素在裡面

1104
00:57:03,634 --> 00:57:06,696
那就是問一下說那這個元素是怎麼來的

1105
00:57:06,696 --> 00:57:09,998
那其實答案也算是蠻單純就是因為

1106
00:57:11,015 --> 00:57:14,218
就是大馬華人也算是很多嘛

1107
00:57:14,218 --> 00:57:16,740
那基本上他們自己就有相關的

1108
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,381
就是耳濡目染的背景做在裡面

1109
00:57:18,381 --> 00:57:22,024
所以在那邊會使用一些

1110
00:57:22,024 --> 00:57:24,206
就是中國或是華文的元素

1111
00:57:24,206 --> 00:57:26,447
也是算是蠻自然的

1112
00:57:26,447 --> 00:57:30,210
那像他剛剛最後有提到一個例子是說

1113
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:31,531
就是節奏為什麼要數1234567

1114
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,632
是單純就是說

1115
00:57:32,632 --> 00:57:37,496
就是因為他的其中一個配音員的

1116
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,557
就是幫遊戲配音的朋友就是

1117
00:57:40,186 --> 00:57:41,927
臨時起性的提案

1118
00:57:41,927 --> 00:57:43,708
那後來就開始有越來越多

1119
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:47,351
就是說那乾脆可能就是說

1120
00:57:47,351 --> 00:57:50,113
一些曲目或者說一些

1121
00:57:50,113 --> 00:57:51,374
使用的樂器的風格

1122
00:57:51,374 --> 00:57:54,236
也可以就是往這個方向去嘗試這樣子

1123
00:57:54,236 --> 00:57:56,897
對那也沒有特別刻意的去做什麼

1124
00:57:56,897 --> 00:57:59,259
什麼安排

1125
00:57:59,259 --> 00:58:02,481
那只是說後來他因為有拿到那個

1126
00:58:02,481 --> 00:58:05,703
你的公司是Indynova對吧

1127
00:58:05,703 --> 00:58:06,264
對 你有跟他們見面嗎

1128
00:58:07,352 --> 00:58:13,697
No, I haven't met them. I know their forum, but I don't know them personally.

1129
00:58:13,697 --> 00:58:15,278
對,那就是

1130
00:58:15,278 --> 00:58:21,463
中國有一個獨立遊戲的發行商叫IndieNova,那他算是後來Risen Doctor,就是傑作一生的

1131
00:58:21,463 --> 00:58:23,064
就是發行商

1132
00:58:23,064 --> 00:58:28,489
他們那時候就是有幫他再多做一些,就是再多給一些資助讓他可以做比較多的

1133
00:58:28,489 --> 00:58:31,291
比如說歌曲有雙版本,或是說可以做

1134
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,053
就是多版本的

1135
00:58:33,053 --> 00:58:33,573
這個口語配音這樣子

1136
00:58:33,573 --> 00:58:33,593
對那

1137
00:58:37,912 --> 00:58:38,053
Okay.

1138
00:58:38,053 --> 00:58:44,734
Okay, so before I open up to the audience questions,

1139
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:52,976
I have, I guess my final question here,

1140
00:58:52,976 --> 00:58:56,357
because actually, due to the translation,

1141
00:58:56,357 --> 00:58:57,918
we are kind of over time now,

1142
00:58:57,918 --> 00:59:02,279
but I do want to ask you one of the final aspect

1143
00:59:02,279 --> 00:59:05,179
that I want to ask.

1144
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:05,259
So.

1145
00:59:08,854 --> 00:59:14,798
Both your games, like Dofi and Rhythm Doctor,

1146
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:22,905
they have a pretty big and integrated community

1147
00:59:22,905 --> 00:59:24,166
aspect built into the game.

1148
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:27,048
I would say like almost from the beginning.

1149
00:59:27,048 --> 00:59:30,011
So as an indie game developer,

1150
00:59:30,011 --> 00:59:33,454
how did you start to, you know,

1151
00:59:33,454 --> 00:59:38,378
how did you start to plan that kind of community integration

1152
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:41,838
and how, like, you made a level editor,

1153
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:44,981
but was the level editor started out

1154
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:48,024
as just a tool for yourself, or you think like,

1155
00:59:48,024 --> 00:59:50,707
okay, actually I want to make this level editor

1156
00:59:50,707 --> 00:59:52,288
for the community as well?

1157
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,431
Okay, so, actually, like, none of the games

1158
00:59:55,431 --> 00:59:58,414
started with the level editor,

1159
00:59:58,414 --> 01:00:00,315
so, like, that happened quite late.

1160
01:00:01,226 --> 01:00:04,228
Like for AdoPhi, for example, it only happened after release,

1161
01:00:04,228 --> 01:00:09,150
because after we released, someone in the community

1162
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:13,233
made their own level editor as a separate tool.

1163
01:00:13,233 --> 01:00:16,354
Like they basically remade AdoPhi on their own

1164
01:00:16,354 --> 01:00:17,155
with a level editor.

1165
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:20,957
So we're like, oh no, why don't we

1166
01:00:20,957 --> 01:00:23,538
get this guy to work for us instead

1167
01:00:23,538 --> 01:00:24,979
and make the level editor for us?

1168
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:28,532
So we're like, OK, do you want to make the level editor officially?

1169
01:00:28,532 --> 01:00:30,554
So and he was like, OK, sure.

1170
01:00:30,554 --> 01:00:31,736
This person is Morpheus.

1171
01:00:31,736 --> 01:00:32,717
His name is Morpheus.

1172
01:00:32,717 --> 01:00:38,102
He was he's like only a teenager, but he was on our Discord.

1173
01:00:40,205 --> 01:00:41,306
Yeah, he was really young.

1174
01:00:41,306 --> 01:00:46,991
He was on our Discord and he was sharing his fan made level editor.

1175
01:00:46,991 --> 01:00:53,217
And also for Rhythm Doctor, we didn't really plan on making a level editor at all.

1176
01:00:53,217 --> 01:00:59,423
So for the first few years, like for the IGF and all that, there was no level editor at all.

1177
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:02,065
What happened was we started, like 2016, we started

1178
01:01:04,198 --> 01:01:09,403
Because we really wanted to motivate ourselves to continue work on the game.

1179
01:01:09,403 --> 01:01:13,686
So what we did was we decided to make levels and release them to our newsletter.

1180
01:01:13,686 --> 01:01:18,710
So they were like private, privately only to our newsletter subscribers.

1181
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:24,114
And every month we would try to release one level and then we get feedback.

1182
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:30,219
So for one of the newsletters, we wanted to ask them, what do they want?

1183
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:31,280
So we had a survey.

1184
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,140
It's like what kind of.

1185
01:01:32,427 --> 01:01:33,268
What kind of stuff do you want?

1186
01:01:33,268 --> 01:01:35,469
Do you want like a two player mode?

1187
01:01:35,469 --> 01:01:37,671
Do you want like leaderboards, stuff like that?

1188
01:01:37,671 --> 01:01:39,112
Then everyone said level editor.

1189
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:39,712
So we were like, okay.

1190
01:01:39,712 --> 01:01:44,776
So we were never really thinking about level editor

1191
01:01:44,776 --> 01:01:45,496
up until then.

1192
01:01:45,496 --> 01:01:47,738
Something I want to tell you though,

1193
01:01:47,738 --> 01:01:50,120
maybe you want to translate this first

1194
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,021
and then I'll continue.

1195
01:01:52,021 --> 01:01:53,562
Okay, okay, let's translate it first.

1196
01:01:58,145 --> 01:02:02,628
目前你在看的話就是傑作醫生還有他之前的那個冰與火之舞

1197
01:02:02,628 --> 01:02:07,452
他其實都有關卡設計的編輯器

1198
01:02:07,452 --> 01:02:12,536
那我本來是想問他說那這個編輯器是一開始就有去打算要做還是說後來才加入

1199
01:02:12,536 --> 01:02:14,838
那他就講說其實冰與火之舞那款遊戲的編輯器是

1200
01:02:14,838 --> 01:02:14,858
應該說兩款遊戲

1201
01:02:20,615 --> 01:02:23,616
冰與火之舞的編輯器是遊戲上市後才做的

1202
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:25,316
因為那款遊戲製作期很短

1203
01:02:25,316 --> 01:02:30,457
然後他丟出來之後就是有玩家自己製作了

1204
01:02:30,457 --> 01:02:34,098
就是等於說是非官方的編輯器

1205
01:02:34,098 --> 01:02:38,439
那因為其實你也可以想像那款遊戲本質上很單純

1206
01:02:38,439 --> 01:02:44,400
所以就很像說他就是一個可以讀特定譜面的程式

1207
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,420
然後可以播音效然後加編輯器

1208
01:02:47,564 --> 01:02:50,305
那就是說等於說有一個玩家已經有一個

1209
01:02:50,305 --> 01:02:55,226
完全非官方的遊戲的那個複製版就已經出來了這樣

1210
01:02:55,226 --> 01:02:56,966
對他就想說那怎麼辦怎麼辦

1211
01:02:56,966 --> 01:02:59,326
那就想說乾脆直接跟那個人問說

1212
01:02:59,326 --> 01:03:02,207
你要不要來直接來團隊裡工作比較快

1213
01:03:02,207 --> 01:03:04,647
那後來就是聯絡上了那個

1214
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:07,208
做那個非官方版本編輯器的開發者

1215
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:07,968
然後就請他進來

1216
01:03:07,968 --> 01:03:12,709
然後就後來發現說原來對方是一個就是十幾歲的小夥子

1217
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:15,950
然後就是整個團隊的人現在都很年輕就對了

1218
01:03:17,182 --> 01:03:23,084
那第二部分是他在那個

1219
01:03:23,084 --> 01:03:26,005
節奏醫生在開發的過程中就是

1220
01:03:26,005 --> 01:03:29,006
因為想要讓自己還有一些動力

1221
01:03:29,006 --> 01:03:30,526
繼續穩定的持續產出內容

1222
01:03:30,526 --> 01:03:33,387
所以他就也是一樣開了一個

1223
01:03:33,387 --> 01:03:37,608
像是電子報的東西

1224
01:03:37,608 --> 01:03:41,690
那就是會每個月會發送一個新關卡給

1225
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:42,510
就是私下有訂閱這個電子報的粉絲

1226
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:48,890
那其中一期他就直接問粉絲說

1227
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:54,074
那就是大家希望在《節奏一生》

1228
01:03:54,074 --> 01:03:55,735
這個遊戲裡面看到怎樣的內容

1229
01:03:55,735 --> 01:03:57,556
對 然後那時候好像

1230
01:03:57,556 --> 01:03:58,857
他剛剛講說是2016還2017年

1231
01:03:58,857 --> 01:04:01,519
那就是說所有人那時候都回應說

1232
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:03,760
就是他們想要看到是

1233
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,241
《節奏一生》的關卡編輯器

1234
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:07,162
那就好 好吧 那就是既然

1235
01:04:07,162 --> 01:04:08,963
就是粉絲都要求了

1236
01:04:08,963 --> 01:04:10,064
那就做這樣子

1237
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,322
所以兩款遊戲都等於算是

1238
01:04:14,322 --> 01:04:16,964
一開始其實並沒有去想到要做關卡編輯這件事情

1239
01:04:16,964 --> 01:04:17,124
OK

1240
01:04:17,124 --> 01:04:18,766
You can continue

1241
01:04:18,766 --> 01:04:18,966
OK, so...

1242
01:04:18,966 --> 01:04:24,491
I'm gonna talk about this level editor thing

1243
01:04:24,491 --> 01:04:27,613
It's actually quite dangerous

1244
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,915
to make a level editor

1245
01:04:29,915 --> 01:04:31,336
And this is why like...

1246
01:04:32,247 --> 01:04:36,508
what we thought at first, right? It's like making a level editor is kind of,

1247
01:04:36,508 --> 01:04:42,290
it's like, it's just a tool, right? Like Audacity or like FL Studio or, you know, Adobe. Like people

1248
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:46,891
can just make stuff in it, they can share it, they can save files, they can open files. Like,

1249
01:04:46,891 --> 01:04:51,772
what's wrong with that? You know, it's just a tool. The problem is, it actually gets quite

1250
01:04:51,772 --> 01:04:58,254
political because if you make a level editor, if it's a normal game, it's fine, you know, people

1251
01:04:58,254 --> 01:04:58,594
just...

1252
01:04:59,408 --> 01:05:02,450
like people just make whatever levels they want.

1253
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:07,593
No, I guess even for platform games, people can make like Nazi symbols in the level editor.

1254
01:05:07,593 --> 01:05:09,874
But that's not what I'm talking about.

1255
01:05:09,874 --> 01:05:12,376
Not here.

1256
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:19,460
The thing is, for music game level editors, when people say like,

1257
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,101
when we ask everyone, like, what do you want?

1258
01:05:21,101 --> 01:05:23,442
And they say, I want a level editor.

1259
01:05:23,442 --> 01:05:28,985
What most people are thinking of is, I want to use my favorite song in the level editor.

1260
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,681
So they're not thinking, I want to make my own song and I want

1261
01:05:32,681 --> 01:05:33,501
to make a level there.

1262
01:05:33,501 --> 01:05:36,262
No, they're thinking, Oh, I really like my favorite artist song.

1263
01:05:36,262 --> 01:05:38,664
I want to make a level with that song.

1264
01:05:38,664 --> 01:05:41,545
And this is where it gets kind of dangerous.

1265
01:05:41,545 --> 01:05:51,430
Because so do you agree that sometimes tools made without

1266
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:53,631
any instructions can be dangerous?

1267
01:05:53,631 --> 01:05:53,911
Yeah.

1268
01:05:55,217 --> 01:06:00,381
So what happened with this was that people were making songs with their favorite artists,

1269
01:06:00,381 --> 01:06:03,242
and those favorite artists, they didn't want it.

1270
01:06:03,242 --> 01:06:06,965
They didn't want their songs to be made in the level editor.

1271
01:06:06,965 --> 01:06:09,326
So there's a few approaches to this, actually.

1272
01:06:09,326 --> 01:06:15,290
So we had spent a lot of time on this because some of those artists got angry with us because

1273
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:20,934
they say it's unethical to make a level editor when you know people are going to use

1274
01:06:20,934 --> 01:06:22,715
other artists' music in that level editor.

1275
01:06:23,557 --> 01:06:25,498
And I see their point.

1276
01:06:25,498 --> 01:06:30,783
At first, my viewpoint was that level editors are just neutral tools.

1277
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,304
It's like making FL Studio.

1278
01:06:32,304 --> 01:06:36,808
Anyone can make a remix, unauthorized remix in FL Studio and share it.

1279
01:06:36,808 --> 01:06:39,230
So what's the difference with our game?

1280
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:43,694
But I think it goes beyond that, because even though it may be legally okay,

1281
01:06:43,694 --> 01:06:45,536
morally, there's something gray there.

1282
01:06:46,471 --> 01:06:52,295
Because a lot of artists, right, how they make money is, like,

1283
01:06:52,295 --> 01:06:57,860
especially rhythm game artists, they make money by licensing

1284
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:00,602
their tracks to other rhythm games.

1285
01:07:00,602 --> 01:07:05,986
So if there is a level editor and people use their songs

1286
01:07:05,986 --> 01:07:13,291
without us, like, buying a license for every song that every player wants to use,

1287
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:15,753
it might, it might

1288
01:07:16,687 --> 01:07:21,228
it might be greater exclusivity off their tracks

1289
01:07:21,228 --> 01:07:25,810
because it's now more common compared to before

1290
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:28,531
when it was only licensed to specific games.

1291
01:07:28,531 --> 01:07:30,932
So I know in the kind of artist community,

1292
01:07:30,932 --> 01:07:32,873
there's a game, do you know Osu?

1293
01:07:32,873 --> 01:07:33,513
Yeah, I know Osu.

1294
01:07:33,513 --> 01:07:34,573
There's a game called Osu.

1295
01:07:34,573 --> 01:07:35,074
Yeah, I know Osu.

1296
01:07:35,074 --> 01:07:39,115
Yeah, it's like a circle, you click the circles.

1297
01:07:39,115 --> 01:07:39,775
Yeah.

1298
01:07:39,775 --> 01:07:42,837
And that's a huge community where everything is custom,

1299
01:07:42,837 --> 01:07:44,337
everything is like custom levels,

1300
01:07:44,337 --> 01:07:45,838
everything is made for a level editor.

1301
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:51,660
And that attracts a lot of anger from artists because, you know,

1302
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:55,001
the developer profits from that because, you know, they sell

1303
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:58,943
subscriptions to osu!. They sell, like, subscriptions to the leaderboard.

1304
01:07:58,943 --> 01:08:02,184
You can get supporter. They sell all the tools and stuff.

1305
01:08:02,184 --> 01:08:06,806
So indirectly, they are making money from artists' work without paying them.

1306
01:08:06,806 --> 01:08:10,327
So that's the whole gist of it.

1307
01:08:10,327 --> 01:08:12,168
So that's what we started to get into, right?

1308
01:08:12,168 --> 01:08:15,630
Because when we released the level editor, we didn't think about these things.

1309
01:08:16,043 --> 01:08:19,886
that's when it starts to feel like, oh, are we profiting from these artists?

1310
01:08:19,886 --> 01:08:23,228
Like, we have our own, we have our own levels. We have, you know, because like,

1311
01:08:23,228 --> 01:08:26,771
like that's the main game, right? We have our own levels in both games, but

1312
01:08:26,771 --> 01:08:31,854
there's a question of like, how much are we, like, how much are we benefiting from

1313
01:08:31,854 --> 01:08:37,178
these custom levels that other people are making? So we had a big talk with our team,

1314
01:08:37,178 --> 01:08:40,801
like, what do we do? Like, do we just cancel the level editor? Do we delete it?

1315
01:08:42,501 --> 01:08:49,606
Do we delete all levels that weren't made by artists who gave permission?

1316
01:08:49,606 --> 01:08:53,068
So what we did in the end was we actually thought for a long time.

1317
01:08:53,068 --> 01:08:56,151
We made something called a verified artist list.

1318
01:08:56,151 --> 01:08:57,351
So it's a website.

1319
01:08:57,351 --> 01:09:00,434
It's integrated with the game.

1320
01:09:00,434 --> 01:09:03,576
And if you type any artist in our level editor,

1321
01:09:03,576 --> 01:09:06,758
it'll first check the website, the database,

1322
01:09:06,758 --> 01:09:08,659
to see if that artist has given permission before.

1323
01:09:09,387 --> 01:09:13,670
And if they haven't given permission, then they won't let you upload it.

1324
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:15,390
So it's a whitelist system.

1325
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:21,554
So whitelist means that every song has been approved by the artist before they can use it.

1326
01:09:21,554 --> 01:09:23,275
So we transitioned into this system.

1327
01:09:23,275 --> 01:09:27,377
One of the problems was that we had all these old levels, right?

1328
01:09:27,377 --> 01:09:31,679
You know, the users, they spend a lot of time making these.

1329
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:32,880
So we kind of had to decide, like...

1330
01:09:34,015 --> 01:09:39,867
Do we want to delete all of these old levels so that we can be, we can be like pure, can

1331
01:09:39,867 --> 01:09:41,451
be pure again?

1332
01:09:41,451 --> 01:09:42,212
So we did.

1333
01:09:42,212 --> 01:09:45,118
So we actually had to like, it was a hard decision, but we.

1334
01:09:46,092 --> 01:09:51,434
We had talked to the community and we said, we're going to have to disable access to all these.

1335
01:09:51,434 --> 01:09:54,815
So none of these were shared on official platforms anyway.

1336
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,256
So it's shared on non-official.

1337
01:09:56,256 --> 01:10:01,918
Of course, we wouldn't share songs we don't have to license on our actual platform in the game itself.

1338
01:10:01,918 --> 01:10:04,679
So these are all on the fan discord and stuff like that.

1339
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:08,180
But even then, even though we don't own that platform.

1340
01:10:08,761 --> 01:10:13,444
Even though we don't make many directly, there's still a moral question

1341
01:10:13,444 --> 01:10:16,686
about whether we are profiting indirectly.

1342
01:10:16,686 --> 01:10:21,149
So because of that, we decided we kind of clamped down on all

1343
01:10:21,149 --> 01:10:25,732
the old levels, and we only start approving levels once they got

1344
01:10:25,732 --> 01:10:27,353
permission from the artists.

1345
01:10:27,353 --> 01:10:28,494
And that's what we did.

1346
01:10:28,494 --> 01:10:30,095
So Yakomo, our programmer.

1347
01:10:30,746 --> 01:10:31,866
He's in Peru.

1348
01:10:31,866 --> 01:10:35,647
So he had a friend, Diego, who was good at web development.

1349
01:10:35,647 --> 01:10:39,949
So he could make a database of artists

1350
01:10:39,949 --> 01:10:41,429
who would allow their songs to be used.

1351
01:10:41,429 --> 01:10:44,390
And then we would ask everyone to,

1352
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:47,171
we'll ask everyone to contact the artists

1353
01:10:47,171 --> 01:10:50,072
and then they have to email, they have to get a response.

1354
01:10:50,072 --> 01:10:52,553
And then they would upload the response to the website.

1355
01:10:52,553 --> 01:10:53,953
And then someone, one of our team.

1356
01:10:54,634 --> 01:10:59,598
It's like his name is Oth. He's our Korean translator as well.

1357
01:10:59,598 --> 01:11:03,521
But he also manages this database. So he'll approve levels.

1358
01:11:03,521 --> 01:11:07,464
He'll approve artists who have given their permission.

1359
01:11:07,464 --> 01:11:10,686
And then we have it along this. And that kind of works.

1360
01:11:10,686 --> 01:11:13,088
And then also what we do from there is like if we see...

1361
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:19,732
songs get popular, we will contact the artist to ask for to buy a license, to buy like an official

1362
01:11:19,732 --> 01:11:25,455
license. So then it will be transferred from just a user made level into an official level and then

1363
01:11:25,455 --> 01:11:30,697
we pay them and they get the compensation for it. But anyway, yeah, so like conclusion, like level

1364
01:11:30,697 --> 01:11:35,099
editors can be quite quite dangerous. So like there's a lot of things to think about before

1365
01:11:35,099 --> 01:11:41,162
you just make a level editor and just give it to people. Yeah. But I think I still think that's

1366
01:11:41,162 --> 01:11:42,543
like a good.

1367
01:11:43,765 --> 01:11:46,808
like a good problem that you have.

1368
01:11:46,808 --> 01:11:48,669
It's not like a bad problem.

1369
01:11:48,669 --> 01:11:52,814
It's like your game is popular, so people,

1370
01:11:52,814 --> 01:11:54,916
or like your game mechanics attracts people, so.

1371
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:59,781
There are people who, there are players who want to use your

1372
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:03,223
platform to make custom levels.

1373
01:12:03,223 --> 01:12:03,703
And so, yeah, yeah.

1374
01:12:03,703 --> 01:12:06,605
So actually, so, so like, like there's, there is the other thing, right.

1375
01:12:06,605 --> 01:12:10,508
So, um, artists usually like, like the reason why they would get angry is

1376
01:12:10,508 --> 01:12:15,011
because if a level is like a custom level, it's really popular in a.

1377
01:12:16,775 --> 01:12:24,000
in our game, the fans would start going to their songs, like on YouTube, the video and

1378
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,921
say like, Oh, this is the song from Autofire.

1379
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:27,783
This is the song from Rhythm Doctor.

1380
01:12:28,388 --> 01:12:32,550
And then their song, which has no relation to our game,

1381
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:35,672
fans would start to associate it with the game.

1382
01:12:35,672 --> 01:12:40,896
And it's kind of insulting to them as well that this happens.

1383
01:12:40,896 --> 01:12:42,116
I know what you mean.

1384
01:12:42,116 --> 01:12:48,360
It's a good problem to have, but it doesn't feel like a good problem to have.

1385
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:48,560
I get it.

1386
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,101
It's kind of dangerous, right?

1387
01:12:50,101 --> 01:12:53,223
We want to be cool with the community.

1388
01:12:53,984 --> 01:13:01,830
Like, we have a lot of different parties who have different desires and different wants and stuff.

1389
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:07,555
Like the fans, they want to make levels for any song they want.

1390
01:13:07,555 --> 01:13:11,398
The artists, they don't want fans to make levels for their song and so on.

1391
01:13:11,398 --> 01:13:14,721
So that's what I mean by political.

1392
01:13:14,721 --> 01:13:20,365
You have to start to consider everyone's viewpoints.

1393
01:13:20,365 --> 01:13:23,368
Yeah, it's a very good point.

1394
01:13:24,618 --> 01:13:25,939
所以我會嘗試翻譯這段問題

1395
01:13:25,939 --> 01:13:32,922
因為這也是一個非常重要的一部分

1396
01:13:32,922 --> 01:13:36,284
好那就是我現在最後要翻譯

1397
01:13:36,284 --> 01:13:38,264
就是我剛剛問的這段問題

1398
01:13:38,264 --> 01:13:40,585
如果有人有想要問問題的話

1399
01:13:40,585 --> 01:13:42,246
就是等一下可能舉個手

1400
01:13:42,246 --> 01:13:43,587
等一下就是

1401
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:45,808
有問題的話我這邊有另外一個麥克風

1402
01:13:45,808 --> 01:13:46,688
可以遞給你們

1403
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:48,649
好那我就是先翻譯一下

1404
01:13:48,649 --> 01:13:49,029
剛剛的這段結論

1405
01:13:49,029 --> 01:13:49,309
就是說為什麼講到這個

1406
01:13:55,832 --> 01:13:59,754
關卡編輯器在音樂遊戲裡面其實是還蠻危險的一件事情

1407
01:13:59,754 --> 01:14:04,937
是因為很多音樂遊戲

1408
01:14:04,937 --> 01:14:08,459
就是他們跟作曲家

1409
01:14:08,459 --> 01:14:10,460
就是合作的方式是

1410
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:15,323
作曲家會把自己的一些樂曲可能就是授權給特定幾款遊戲使用

1411
01:14:15,323 --> 01:14:17,704
或是可能就是只有特定一款遊戲

1412
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:18,564
那

1413
01:14:18,564 --> 01:14:18,725
就是

1414
01:14:19,931 --> 01:14:21,531
這個交易能夠成立

1415
01:14:21,531 --> 01:14:23,112
其實有一個前提是說

1416
01:14:23,112 --> 01:14:25,573
基本上它不是免費的發送給所有人

1417
01:14:25,573 --> 01:14:28,893
你在什麼遊戲裡面都可以玩到這首歌

1418
01:14:28,893 --> 01:14:33,875
那就是相對來講它的價值

1419
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:36,516
就是如果你是說這個樂曲

1420
01:14:36,516 --> 01:14:38,296
只有這款節奏遊戲

1421
01:14:38,296 --> 01:14:39,916
或是只有這款音樂遊戲才有的話

1422
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:42,137
它的價值其實相對來講

1423
01:14:42,137 --> 01:14:43,217
應該會稍微高一點

1424
01:14:43,217 --> 01:14:46,558
那如果說你今天是允許玩家自己去

1425
01:14:48,089 --> 01:14:55,316
使用你的關卡編輯器然後就載入樂曲然後就編譜面的話

1426
01:14:55,316 --> 01:14:58,519
那其實很容易產生一個狀況就是

1427
01:14:58,519 --> 01:15:02,883
你的遊戲會裡面可能會充斥很多感覺好像很有名的

1428
01:15:02,883 --> 01:15:05,985
曲子或是說可能都已經有YouTube

1429
01:15:05,985 --> 01:15:10,129
的內容製作者都已經用你的

1430
01:15:10,129 --> 01:15:12,351
都已經用那些相關就是自訂譜面自訂樂曲

1431
01:15:14,455 --> 01:15:16,656
然後都已經在YouTube上很紅了

1432
01:15:16,656 --> 01:15:18,377
可是實際上

1433
01:15:18,377 --> 01:15:21,578
這樣會造成一個就是

1434
01:15:21,578 --> 01:15:23,379
算是著作權上的爭議啦

1435
01:15:23,379 --> 01:15:28,662
那因為使用這些樂曲的人

1436
01:15:28,662 --> 01:15:33,124
他本身並沒有跟原本的作曲家取得授權

1437
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:38,522
那今天只是說玩家個人喜歡聽這個音樂

1438
01:15:38,522 --> 01:15:40,183
然後可能喜歡這款遊戲的機制

1439
01:15:40,183 --> 01:15:43,346
所以他就用那個光碟編輯器把它做進來

1440
01:15:43,346 --> 01:15:47,288
那這樣的話其實會造成一個很危險的現象就是

1441
01:15:47,288 --> 01:15:48,709
你遊戲裡面可能會充斥的非常多

1442
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:51,371
其實根本就沒有被授權的音樂

1443
01:15:51,371 --> 01:15:54,674
那這個時候開發者那個

1444
01:15:54,674 --> 01:15:56,635
就是開發者那一段他要處理或不處理

1445
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,716
就會變成是一個很棘手的狀況

1446
01:15:58,716 --> 01:16:01,779
所以哈菲斯剛剛有舉另外一個例子是

1447
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,964
有一款最早應該是從NDS上面

1448
01:16:07,964 --> 01:16:09,946
就是應援團

1449
01:16:09,946 --> 01:16:11,788
衍生出來的一個節奏遊戲玩法

1450
01:16:11,788 --> 01:16:13,991
然後那個遊戲它後來

1451
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:15,232
應該就是在PC上有一個

1452
01:16:15,232 --> 01:16:17,194
就是直接有一個算是Clone

1453
01:16:17,194 --> 01:16:19,376
就叫OSU

1454
01:16:19,376 --> 01:16:21,378
也是原本應援團遊戲的

1455
01:16:21,378 --> 01:16:22,820
就是念法就對了

1456
01:16:23,875 --> 01:16:29,638
總之那款遊戲就有非常多的無段轉載自製的譜面

1457
01:16:29,638 --> 01:16:33,080
然後就是使用那種沒有授權的其他作曲家的音樂

1458
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:37,001
然後其實很多音樂作者

1459
01:16:37,001 --> 01:16:40,563
就是對那款遊戲上面有這麼多充斥這種

1460
01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:44,445
他們毫無管理的狀態就是很反感就對了

1461
01:16:44,445 --> 01:16:50,248
那節奏醫生其實一開始也是有遇到一點這樣的問題

1462
01:16:50,248 --> 01:16:51,209
對那他們是

1463
01:16:54,233 --> 01:16:57,214
應該說是有人跟他們提出一些反應之後

1464
01:16:57,214 --> 01:16:59,855
那節奏一聲的團隊才私下討論說

1465
01:16:59,855 --> 01:17:04,557
那當初是玩家要關卡變異器的

1466
01:17:04,557 --> 01:17:07,578
那現在我們是要把關卡變異器砍掉嗎

1467
01:17:07,578 --> 01:17:11,480
還是說我們要用什麼方式去管理

1468
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,121
怎麼做關卡這件事情

1469
01:17:13,121 --> 01:17:15,281
或怎麼上傳關卡這件事情

1470
01:17:15,281 --> 01:17:17,883
所以他們後來的做法是

1471
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:22,805
在官方網站上面就是有列一個就是白名單

1472
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:22,825
是

1473
01:17:24,309 --> 01:17:27,830
這上面的列表的音樂作者

1474
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:29,830
是已經同意他的遊戲

1475
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:32,251
可以在節奏一生這款遊戲裡面

1476
01:17:32,251 --> 01:17:34,432
被拿來自製譜面

1477
01:17:34,432 --> 01:17:37,312
只有這些人的音樂可以這樣做

1478
01:17:37,312 --> 01:17:38,273
而且他還包括

1479
01:17:38,273 --> 01:17:38,433
剛剛哈貝斯有強調說

1480
01:17:41,534 --> 01:17:44,435
你要用那個已經verify的作者

1481
01:17:44,435 --> 01:17:46,716
去自製譜面之前

1482
01:17:46,716 --> 01:17:49,057
你還是一樣就是做譜面的那個玩家

1483
01:17:49,057 --> 01:17:51,678
他還是要去跟原本那個做音樂作者

1484
01:17:51,678 --> 01:17:53,119
去取得授權

1485
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:55,900
然後那個授權要有一個書面的樣板

1486
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,461
他就是要做一個簡單的說明

1487
01:17:58,461 --> 01:18:00,261
然後那個東西要連同你的關卡

1488
01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:02,402
你編輯好的關卡一起上傳到server

1489
01:18:02,402 --> 01:18:04,523
然後他們上傳到server那邊

1490
01:18:04,523 --> 01:18:05,964
會有人做人工的檢查

1491
01:18:05,964 --> 01:18:08,525
所以其實是一個非常勞心勞力的流程

1492
01:18:08,525 --> 01:18:09,605
就是他不是像一般的

1493
01:18:10,766 --> 01:18:14,349
譬如說平台遊戲還是什麼動作遊戲的關卡編輯器一樣

1494
01:18:14,349 --> 01:18:17,151
就是把地圖編一編就可以用

1495
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:21,575
它基本上會牽涉到很多原本作曲家本身的權利問題

1496
01:18:21,575 --> 01:18:25,919
那如果某一個樂曲是由玩家自製關卡而紅起來

1497
01:18:25,919 --> 01:18:28,301
那到很紅的程度的時候

1498
01:18:28,301 --> 01:18:30,463
官方團隊甚至會決定說那直接跟

1499
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:34,876
那個音樂作者去彈那一首曲子的授權

1500
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:36,817
那個曲子就不再是

1501
01:18:36,817 --> 01:18:40,939
只是說合格的玩家創作

1502
01:18:40,939 --> 01:18:41,859
玩家譜面的創作

1503
01:18:41,859 --> 01:18:43,320
而是說這款

1504
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:46,381
這個譜面跟那個音樂都會變成官方的內容

1505
01:18:46,381 --> 01:18:48,842
對那其實這是一個非常勞心勞力的過程

1506
01:18:48,842 --> 01:18:52,164
那就是勸大家在

1507
01:18:52,164 --> 01:18:53,324
就是如果你的遊戲

1508
01:18:53,324 --> 01:18:55,285
也許有機會變成這樣子走紅的情況

1509
01:18:57,376 --> 01:18:58,957
特別是像音樂遊戲

1510
01:18:58,957 --> 01:19:03,980
在音樂著作權這方面其實要很花時間去考量

1511
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:09,223
其實以前也有一些其他的遊戲有類似的作法

1512
01:19:09,223 --> 01:19:13,005
就是NDS上面以前有一些遊戲也是有這樣子的設計

1513
01:19:13,005 --> 01:19:16,447
我記得應該有一款叫大合奏吧

1514
01:19:16,447 --> 01:19:19,429
他們也是要有官方先認可的音樂

1515
01:19:19,429 --> 01:19:20,689
他們才能去做譜面這樣子

1516
01:19:25,608 --> 01:19:26,589
所以我會把問題放到現場讓觀眾來問問題

1517
01:19:26,589 --> 01:19:26,989
我先來問

1518
01:19:26,989 --> 01:19:29,851
有沒有人有問題想要問開發者

1519
01:19:29,851 --> 01:19:30,391
你是玩過節奏機車

1520
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:31,811
然後你有些開發上的問題

1521
01:19:31,811 --> 01:19:33,332
還是說對於遊戲本身的問題想要問開發者

1522
01:19:33,332 --> 01:19:34,433
如果有想到的話就是隨時舉手

1523
01:19:34,433 --> 01:19:34,453
有嗎

1524
01:19:56,887 --> 01:19:57,868
還是還要繼續想一下

1525
01:19:57,868 --> 01:19:59,650
如果還要繼續想一下

1526
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:02,933
有問題嗎

1527
01:20:02,933 --> 01:20:03,293
他有玩過

1528
01:20:03,293 --> 01:20:06,517
沒有沒有關係

1529
01:20:06,517 --> 01:20:09,339
有問題的話就就跟我們講

1530
01:20:09,339 --> 01:20:10,360
要玩

1531
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,923
我跟開發者聊一下天

1532
01:20:12,923 --> 01:20:18,848
沒有你要過來前面

1533
01:20:22,491 --> 01:20:33,194
We have the youngest audience here

1534
01:20:33,194 --> 01:20:33,634
沒關係 請你坐這裡沒關係

1535
01:20:33,634 --> 01:20:33,995
Hello

1536
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:40,097
He's here

1537
01:20:40,097 --> 01:20:42,277
Hello

1538
01:20:42,277 --> 01:20:42,397
Hey

1539
01:20:42,397 --> 01:20:47,399
Can you hear me?

1540
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:47,519
你要問問題嗎?

1541
01:20:51,361 --> 01:20:58,005
不要緊張

1542
01:20:58,005 --> 01:20:59,806
不要緊張

1543
01:20:59,806 --> 01:21:00,106
他有點緊張

1544
01:21:00,106 --> 01:21:00,446
沒問題

1545
01:21:00,446 --> 01:21:05,769
我叫周雨欣

1546
01:21:05,769 --> 01:21:08,610
英文名字叫Sean

1547
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:10,792
我和我的同學

1548
01:21:10,792 --> 01:21:12,773
都喜歡節奏醫生

1549
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:21,043
之後我還用Scratch做了一個節奏一生的簡易版

1550
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:24,764
Scratch就是

1551
01:21:24,764 --> 01:21:25,024
嗯

1552
01:21:25,024 --> 01:21:31,207
類似一個開發遊戲的程式

1553
01:21:31,207 --> 01:21:33,388
那

1554
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:36,809
那可不可以

1555
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:42,812
嗯

1556
01:21:42,812 --> 01:21:42,952
不要緊張

1557
01:21:46,663 --> 01:21:56,028
那可不可以給我一些遊戲開發上的建議

1558
01:22:11,502 --> 01:22:18,344
And he and a lot of his friends,

1559
01:22:18,344 --> 01:22:22,465
they are all fans of Risen Doctor.

1560
01:22:22,465 --> 01:22:24,686
Oh, so nice.

1561
01:22:24,686 --> 01:22:29,547
Yeah, and he also made a kind of like a...

1562
01:22:31,483 --> 01:22:34,545
a clone of Rhythm Doctor in Crash.

1563
01:22:34,545 --> 01:22:37,846
I think there's a program or like an author.

1564
01:22:37,846 --> 01:22:39,807
Scratch, okay, Scratch, sorry.

1565
01:22:39,807 --> 01:22:42,848
Yeah, so he kind of made a simpler version

1566
01:22:42,848 --> 01:22:45,910
of Rhythm Doctor in Scratch.

1567
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:51,412
And he would like to know if you have any suggestion

1568
01:22:51,412 --> 01:22:54,233
to this young developer.

1569
01:22:55,871 --> 01:22:56,151
Okay.

1570
01:22:56,151 --> 01:22:59,092
First of all, thank you so much for playing our game.

1571
01:22:59,092 --> 01:23:00,673
It's really nice.

1572
01:23:00,673 --> 01:23:03,134
And thank you for the question.

1573
01:23:03,134 --> 01:23:10,876
And thank you for making a Scratch version of Rhythm Doctor.

1574
01:23:10,876 --> 01:23:12,417
That's really nice to hear.

1575
01:23:12,417 --> 01:23:14,258
Actually, I know Scratch quite well.

1576
01:23:14,258 --> 01:23:20,100
And I've seen a few Rhythm Doctor clones made in Scratch.

1577
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:25,201
Maybe one of them is yours, actually.

1578
01:23:25,201 --> 01:23:25,301
Um...

1579
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:25,462
But...

1580
01:23:27,495 --> 01:23:32,437
Yeah, it's really nice that you are starting young.

1581
01:23:32,437 --> 01:23:38,501
You remind me of when I was 10 years old and I was also making games in Game Maker.

1582
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:41,142
And the first game I made was a clone of Sonic.

1583
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:43,583
So Sonic was one of my favorite games back then.

1584
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:47,025
Sonic the Hedgehog is like a platformer, a 2D platform game.

1585
01:23:47,025 --> 01:23:53,309
And it's nice to see that you are also making clones of other games right now.

1586
01:23:53,309 --> 01:23:57,171
I think that's a really good way to get started to make games.

1587
01:23:58,173 --> 01:24:02,156
我只能建議大家繼續享受遊戲

1588
01:24:02,156 --> 01:24:04,057
我年輕的時候沒有想太多

1589
01:24:04,057 --> 01:24:05,118
我只是做了我喜歡的遊戲

1590
01:24:05,118 --> 01:24:06,999
我高興你喜歡《Rhythm Doctor》

1591
01:24:06,999 --> 01:24:08,980
所以就做了一個複製版

1592
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,080
你可以把遊戲傳給我

1593
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,121
我也會很開心的玩

1594
01:24:11,121 --> 01:24:13,002
我來翻譯一下

1595
01:24:13,002 --> 01:24:15,183
第一個是他先很感謝你們都很喜歡玩他的遊戲

1596
01:24:27,785 --> 01:24:32,586
就是他自己也是蠻就是之前也蠻會用Scratch

1597
01:24:32,586 --> 01:24:34,627
就是開發遊戲的然後

1598
01:24:34,627 --> 01:24:36,368
他說他有看到蠻多

1599
01:24:36,368 --> 01:24:39,869
就是節奏一生的複製品是用

1600
01:24:39,869 --> 01:24:41,910
Scratch做的他說搞不好

1601
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,511
搞不好他有看過你的版本

1602
01:24:44,511 --> 01:24:49,412
那他是他就強調說就是如果如果你

1603
01:24:49,412 --> 01:24:52,894
現在想要就是現在想要開始但是很好的事情他當時也是

1604
01:24:52,894 --> 01:24:54,074
跟你差不多年紀的時候開始做遊戲開發那

1605
01:24:54,074 --> 01:24:54,154
只是說

1606
01:24:56,517 --> 01:25:01,098
一開始的時候就是不要想得太嚴肅或太認真

1607
01:25:01,098 --> 01:25:06,220
就是重點是做你想要做的事情

1608
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:07,320
做你想要玩的遊戲

1609
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:14,003
然後往你以後想要有興趣前進的方向去發展這樣

1610
01:25:14,003 --> 01:25:17,544
那他當初在做的時候也沒有想那麼多

1611
01:25:17,544 --> 01:25:21,746
對 但是總之就是希望你可以繼續努力

1612
01:25:21,746 --> 01:25:22,346
那如果你的

1613
01:25:23,374 --> 01:25:25,796
Scratch的這個節奏一生版本

1614
01:25:25,796 --> 01:25:28,458
你願意的話你也可以提供給他玩

1615
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:31,400
就是你可以跟他講說哪一個版本是你的

1616
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,162
對那如果那他是他很喜歡

1617
01:25:33,162 --> 01:25:36,364
就是他如果他可以玩到你的版本的話

1618
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:39,187
他也會很高興對

1619
01:25:39,187 --> 01:25:40,388
那就是如果你有需要的話

1620
01:25:40,388 --> 01:25:42,489
我們可以幫你轉達

1621
01:25:42,489 --> 01:25:43,670
就是可以幫你把你的那個

1622
01:25:43,670 --> 01:25:44,771
Scratch的版本可以給他看這樣子謝謝

1623
01:25:44,771 --> 01:25:45,451
Yeah he says thanks

1624
01:25:52,807 --> 01:25:53,627
謝謝謝謝你提出的問題

1625
01:25:53,627 --> 01:25:53,767
祝你好運

1626
01:25:53,767 --> 01:25:54,007
祝你好運

1627
01:25:54,007 --> 01:25:54,268
希望以後遊戲開發順利

1628
01:25:54,268 --> 01:25:54,448
好

1629
01:25:54,448 --> 01:25:54,588
感謝

1630
01:25:54,588 --> 01:25:54,748
好

1631
01:25:54,748 --> 01:25:56,089
沒關係

1632
01:25:56,089 --> 01:25:56,889
有沒有其他問題

1633
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:24,065
後面有一位

1634
01:26:24,065 --> 01:26:24,885
你也來前面好了

1635
01:26:24,885 --> 01:26:26,006
因為這邊才看得到

1636
01:26:26,006 --> 01:26:27,126
就是比較看得清楚你在哪邊

1637
01:26:27,126 --> 01:26:27,446
我直接用英文問

1638
01:26:27,446 --> 01:26:27,606
好

1639
01:26:27,606 --> 01:26:27,746
Hello

1640
01:26:27,746 --> 01:26:29,426
So I want to ask more about the

1641
01:26:29,426 --> 01:26:36,368
licensing problem you met

1642
01:26:36,368 --> 01:26:41,269
Cause you said when the

1643
01:26:41,269 --> 01:26:44,650
game level becomes popular

1644
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:51,631
You asked for the license from the

1645
01:26:52,581 --> 01:26:53,661
We will switch, right?

1646
01:26:53,661 --> 01:26:59,303
Then how about the level designer, like the charters?

1647
01:26:59,303 --> 01:27:04,284
Do you need to ask for their permission again?

1648
01:27:04,284 --> 01:27:05,484
Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.

1649
01:27:05,484 --> 01:27:08,945
So what we do is we will offer the level designer.

1650
01:27:08,945 --> 01:27:11,486
So we'll contact both the artist and the level designer.

1651
01:27:11,486 --> 01:27:13,027
And then we'll ask the level designer.

1652
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:14,347
We'll offer them to pay.

1653
01:27:14,347 --> 01:27:17,468
We'll offer to pay them money to use their level in the game.

1654
01:27:18,254 --> 01:27:24,599
And then sometimes we'll pay them more money to like, to design it better or to make some changes for us.

1655
01:27:24,599 --> 01:27:29,462
Because usually custom levels, when they become official levels,

1656
01:27:29,462 --> 01:27:33,786
us as the game design team, we might want to change some stuff here and there.

1657
01:27:33,786 --> 01:27:38,189
But yeah, so like, like I think legally, legally, you know, some.

1658
01:27:39,479 --> 01:27:43,901
Some games, like for Nintendo, for example,

1659
01:27:43,901 --> 01:27:46,602
they have a clause where anything you make in the level

1660
01:27:46,602 --> 01:27:50,744
editor belongs to Nintendo or something like that.

1661
01:27:50,744 --> 01:27:55,406
And even though that might be true,

1662
01:27:55,406 --> 01:28:00,549
we still want to compensate the level designers for their time.

1663
01:28:00,549 --> 01:28:05,211
So we always offer to pay some amount to them.

1664
01:28:05,211 --> 01:28:06,552
OK, I understand.

1665
01:28:07,117 --> 01:28:15,261
Then how about if the level design contains non-authorized materials?

1666
01:28:15,261 --> 01:28:20,203
Oh no, I mean if there's other unauthorized materials.

1667
01:28:20,203 --> 01:28:27,087
Wait, do you mean like to make it an official level?

1668
01:28:27,087 --> 01:28:28,707
So if the...

1669
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:41,578
If game level becomes popular, you will ask for both the musician and the level designers' permission to put it in official level.

1670
01:28:41,578 --> 01:28:49,583
Then what if the level designers' material is using non-authorized?

1671
01:28:50,786 --> 01:28:51,266
Okay.

1672
01:28:51,266 --> 01:28:58,453
We haven't seen that before, but usually we would either, we would usually like get licensing

1673
01:28:58,453 --> 01:28:59,273
for that material.

1674
01:28:59,273 --> 01:29:05,319
Maybe it's like a video or maybe it's like, yes, sometimes rhythm game songs that they

1675
01:29:05,319 --> 01:29:06,540
come with a video.

1676
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:12,865
So we also pay the person who made the video to license that video as part of it as well.

1677
01:29:13,907 --> 01:29:16,088
所以如果我們不能獲得許可權的話

1678
01:29:16,088 --> 01:29:19,970
例如它使用了Spongebob或其他巨大的遊戲

1679
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:21,651
我們就無法獲得許可權

1680
01:29:21,651 --> 01:29:23,652
那當然我們會請他們先取消許可權

1681
01:29:23,652 --> 01:29:24,032
OK 謝謝謝謝

1682
01:29:24,032 --> 01:29:26,193
OK 我還是簡單講一下剛剛的問題

1683
01:29:26,193 --> 01:29:26,593
就是如果

1684
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:44,699
關卡設計裡面

1685
01:29:44,699 --> 01:29:50,242
譬如說是關卡設計就是那普面的元素或是說他普面背後播的一些圖片啊影片可能是

1686
01:29:50,242 --> 01:29:51,463
其實是

1687
01:29:51,463 --> 01:29:55,265
有版權疑慮的那這個他們當然在

1688
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:58,907
正式化成為官方版本之前他一定是

1689
01:29:58,907 --> 01:30:03,070
要嘛要取得權利要嘛是要求他移除這樣子

1690
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:08,913
那剛剛有強調說除了他會付費給音樂使用者之外音樂製作人之外他也會

1691
01:30:08,913 --> 01:30:09,573
付給

1692
01:30:09,573 --> 01:30:09,673
就是說

1693
01:30:11,764 --> 01:30:15,426
當那個關卡那個普面變成正式版的時候

1694
01:30:15,426 --> 01:30:20,667
他也會付就是像是關卡普面的費用給當初上傳那個人這樣

1695
01:30:20,667 --> 01:30:23,889
好還有沒有其他問題

1696
01:30:23,889 --> 01:30:34,452
嗯沒關係如果有如果有的話等一下再隨時舉手問

1697
01:30:34,452 --> 01:30:34,913
OK好這個

1698
01:30:34,913 --> 01:30:40,175
We have a question from Twitch actually

1699
01:30:42,444 --> 01:30:43,205
I'll...

1700
01:30:43,205 --> 01:30:47,288
It's a bit of a hassle for me to turn on Twitch,

1701
01:30:47,288 --> 01:30:48,909
because it will block the screen.

1702
01:30:48,909 --> 01:30:55,975
So, one of the audience questions on the Twitch was,

1703
01:30:55,975 --> 01:31:07,504
Are you making enough revenue from both of the games

1704
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:11,687
to support the current studio?

1705
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:16,757
to support our studio right now?

1706
01:31:16,757 --> 01:31:16,957
Yeah.

1707
01:31:16,957 --> 01:31:18,218
Yeah, for sure.

1708
01:31:18,218 --> 01:31:21,121
I mean, otherwise, I guess we would be bankrupt, right?

1709
01:31:21,121 --> 01:31:22,962
Otherwise, we wouldn't be continuing.

1710
01:31:22,962 --> 01:31:23,042
Yeah.

1711
01:31:23,042 --> 01:31:24,764
Unless you mean something else?

1712
01:31:24,764 --> 01:31:26,285
Unless they mean something else?

1713
01:31:26,285 --> 01:31:26,686
I'm not sure.

1714
01:31:26,686 --> 01:31:28,047
No, I think that's the question.

1715
01:31:28,047 --> 01:31:31,730
So like, are you comfortable...

1716
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:32,611
Are you comfortable...

1717
01:31:32,611 --> 01:31:33,472
Maybe taking out...

1718
01:31:33,472 --> 01:31:33,712
Sorry.

1719
01:31:33,712 --> 01:31:33,972
Like...

1720
01:31:33,972 --> 01:31:34,172
Like...

1721
01:31:34,172 --> 01:31:34,332
Like...

1722
01:31:34,332 --> 01:31:34,593
Like...

1723
01:31:34,593 --> 01:31:35,613
Like...

1724
01:31:35,613 --> 01:31:35,834
Like...

1725
01:31:35,834 --> 01:31:35,954
Like...

1726
01:31:37,748 --> 01:31:42,091
可能他們期望我們有兼職工作之類的

1727
01:31:42,091 --> 01:31:44,032
來支援工作室

1728
01:31:44,032 --> 01:31:47,975
但現在工作室是自主維持

1729
01:31:47,975 --> 01:31:50,257
我們可以支付所有參與遊戲的工作

1730
01:31:50,257 --> 01:31:53,860
OK,酷

1731
01:31:53,860 --> 01:31:56,122
這樣他們應該有聽到了嘛

1732
01:31:56,122 --> 01:32:00,925
目前確實營收狀況是可以支撐工作室運作的

1733
01:32:04,208 --> 01:32:09,432
But how about when you were still developing the game?

1734
01:32:09,432 --> 01:32:14,995
Because the years of development was so long.

1735
01:32:14,995 --> 01:32:18,077
Like after your graduation, like 2015,

1736
01:32:18,077 --> 01:32:25,242
and then A Dance of Ice and Fire came out, I think in 2008.

1737
01:32:25,869 --> 01:32:29,172
18 or so or something like that?

1738
01:32:29,172 --> 01:32:30,373
Early 19, January 19.

1739
01:32:30,373 --> 01:32:34,478
Yeah, early 19. So there was still like a three, four year gap.

1740
01:32:34,478 --> 01:32:35,719
Like, yeah.

1741
01:32:35,719 --> 01:32:41,125
So that was like, just, you just based on your savings or?

1742
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:48,055
No, so we actually got funding from a Malaysian government and also the Peruvian government.

1743
01:32:48,055 --> 01:32:53,838
So I think one of your questions in the email last time was, how is the game dev scene in Malaysia, right?

1744
01:32:53,838 --> 01:32:54,218
Yeah.

1745
01:32:54,218 --> 01:32:55,879
So that's part of it, actually.

1746
01:32:55,879 --> 01:33:00,081
So the government actually had people who were supportive.

1747
01:33:00,081 --> 01:33:08,345
So they had funding rounds and we would go for a competition, we'd pitch the game.

1748
01:33:08,345 --> 01:33:11,147
And if you win, they'd fund your studio.

1749
01:33:11,747 --> 01:33:18,434
Right. So we got money from that. Actually, it's the same thing in Peru. So Yakomo, there's also

1750
01:33:18,434 --> 01:33:25,762
something like that in Peru, like a startup competition where the winner would get funding.

1751
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:32,015
Right. So Yakomo also got funding on his side and I also got funding on my side.

1752
01:33:32,015 --> 01:33:33,498
So that helped us a lot.

1753
01:33:33,498 --> 01:33:38,485
That's the benefit of a multinational team, right?

1754
01:33:38,485 --> 01:33:40,528
You get money from every country.

1755
01:33:40,528 --> 01:33:41,629
You can get both.

1756
01:33:43,112 --> 01:33:49,436
Yeah. Okay. So like, it was funny because in Malaysia, like, the condition is like, you must

1757
01:33:49,436 --> 01:33:55,280
be at least like 50% Malaysian, the team. Right. And then in Peru, there was like, it has to be

1758
01:33:55,280 --> 01:34:00,484
like 50% Peruvian. So it's like, it balanced out for us. So we could both get our grants.

1759
01:34:00,924 --> 01:34:02,985
Okay, that's very tricky.

1760
01:34:02,985 --> 01:34:09,967
But also, the government also helped us in other ways as well.

1761
01:34:09,967 --> 01:34:15,649
So they gave us a co-working space, so we didn't have to rent any office.

1762
01:34:15,649 --> 01:34:17,030
So we got a co-working space for free.

1763
01:34:17,030 --> 01:34:22,011
And that was good because you could save money, but also because

1764
01:34:22,011 --> 01:34:25,833
we got to meet all the other developers, all the other big indie developers.

1765
01:34:26,464 --> 01:34:28,766
in the country who are also working there.

1766
01:34:28,766 --> 01:34:33,350
So the government basically took all of us and put us in the same office.

1767
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:35,993
And that was really helpful in a lot of ways for us.

1768
01:34:35,993 --> 01:34:40,817
So do you mean that office is for games only?

1769
01:34:40,817 --> 01:34:46,402
Yeah, a space just for game development, for indie game development.

1770
01:34:46,402 --> 01:34:46,703
Okay.

1771
01:34:46,703 --> 01:34:49,085
So we each have one set of tables.

1772
01:34:49,752 --> 01:34:49,832
I see.

1773
01:34:49,832 --> 01:34:54,655
Like, usually the other teams would have like six tables, six people in one table.

1774
01:34:54,655 --> 01:34:54,855
Right.

1775
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:59,018
But then for me, it was just two of us because, you know, the rest of the people are international.

1776
01:34:59,018 --> 01:34:59,558
Right.

1777
01:34:59,558 --> 01:35:03,080
So like, we shared our table with some other developers.

1778
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:08,143
But yeah, so that kind of thing was really important because I think like, if they didn't

1779
01:35:08,143 --> 01:35:10,124
offer a co-working space for free.

1780
01:35:11,465 --> 01:35:13,406
I probably would have thought like it's a waste of money.

1781
01:35:13,406 --> 01:35:16,087
It's like, why can't I just work at home, you know?

1782
01:35:16,087 --> 01:35:16,987
Right, right, right.

1783
01:35:16,987 --> 01:35:21,910
So like I didn't see the benefit of a community until they offered it

1784
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:23,350
and then I was able to experience it.

1785
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:27,352
And I thought, oh, then the benefits were more,

1786
01:35:27,352 --> 01:35:29,153
like I could experience the benefits for myself.

1787
01:35:29,633 --> 01:35:33,696
我每次碰到密碼問題,我都可以從下一個桌子找人幫忙

1788
01:35:33,696 --> 01:35:38,581
或者我每次碰到任何問題,我們都可以一起幫忙

1789
01:35:38,581 --> 01:35:39,722
對我們來說,這是非常重要的

1790
01:35:39,722 --> 01:35:41,103
這是一個非常好的觀點

1791
01:35:41,103 --> 01:35:43,905
因為我覺得這是台灣政府需要去做的事情

1792
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:45,366
好的,我明白

1793
01:35:45,366 --> 01:35:46,307
還有其他問題嗎?

1794
01:35:57,679 --> 01:35:59,341
因為如果沒有的話其實時間也差不多

1795
01:35:59,341 --> 01:36:01,662
我們已經進行了90分鐘了

1796
01:36:01,662 --> 01:36:05,005
所以

1797
01:36:05,005 --> 01:36:06,286
OK那就先這樣囉

1798
01:36:06,286 --> 01:36:07,607
如果有人有問題的話

1799
01:36:07,607 --> 01:36:10,069
可以以後私下再

1800
01:36:10,069 --> 01:36:12,531
Email給

1801
01:36:12,531 --> 01:36:13,452
就是

1802
01:36:13,452 --> 01:36:13,772
Halfiz

1803
01:36:13,772 --> 01:36:15,834
So

1804
01:36:15,834 --> 01:36:20,898
I think the audience question was like

1805
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:22,980
OK for now.

1806
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:28,763
So we also already run for about 90 minutes.

1807
01:36:28,763 --> 01:36:36,766
So I think it's a good time to conclude the event.

1808
01:36:36,766 --> 01:36:43,409
And do you have any parting thoughts on maybe

1809
01:36:43,409 --> 01:36:44,230
give some general.

1810
01:36:46,377 --> 01:36:48,438
suggestions or...

1811
01:36:48,438 --> 01:36:48,738
Okay.

1812
01:36:48,738 --> 01:36:48,898
Yeah.

1813
01:36:48,898 --> 01:36:50,179
Yeah, yeah.

1814
01:36:50,179 --> 01:36:52,180
I do have some things.

1815
01:36:52,180 --> 01:37:01,924
Number one is like, whenever you have problems, don't be afraid to message people on Twitter

1816
01:37:01,924 --> 01:37:03,225
or email them.

1817
01:37:03,225 --> 01:37:08,607
Like other big game developers, even if they're really big, they do answer the emails.

1818
01:37:08,607 --> 01:37:11,808
So even if you email me, I will answer your email.

1819
01:37:11,808 --> 01:37:14,770
So if you're having a problem, for example, like, you know, you're making some kind of

1820
01:37:15,517 --> 01:37:20,219
some kind of special genre game and you know someone who's more experienced,

1821
01:37:20,219 --> 01:37:25,582
don't be afraid to just email them. It's always helped for me. So whenever I get stuck,

1822
01:37:25,582 --> 01:37:31,684
sometimes I've talked to more experienced people. And it's important to remember that you can ask

1823
01:37:31,684 --> 01:37:37,487
for help. And usually, even if they might look busy, they will like to answer your questions

1824
01:37:37,487 --> 01:37:40,808
because number one, it's an honor to receive a question.

1825
01:37:41,718 --> 01:37:45,000
So it's not something that wastes our time.

1826
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,923
It's really nice to receive questions, and it also helps us

1827
01:37:48,923 --> 01:37:52,246
when we answer, because when we answer, we get to put our

1828
01:37:52,246 --> 01:37:54,067
thoughts into writing.

1829
01:37:54,067 --> 01:37:56,969
And usually that process of putting what you think into

1830
01:37:56,969 --> 01:38:00,492
writing helps us as much as it helps the person we are

1831
01:38:00,492 --> 01:38:01,973
writing to.

1832
01:38:01,973 --> 01:38:07,157
And I guess the other thing is beware of publishers.

1833
01:38:07,157 --> 01:38:09,899
This is just a general thing.

1834
01:38:09,899 --> 01:38:10,939
What I want to say is

1835
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,421
Like, when you meet the indie community and people like that,

1836
01:38:15,421 --> 01:38:21,283
it's nice to think that everyone is friendly because everyone is friendly.

1837
01:38:21,283 --> 01:38:27,685
But things become different when there are big companies involved and there are money involved.

1838
01:38:27,685 --> 01:38:28,945
And if you meet a publisher,

1839
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:33,826
they might try to convince you that you need them, even though you don't actually need them.

1840
01:38:34,739 --> 01:38:36,720
And this is something they would do intentionally.

1841
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,700
For example, you know how publishers work?

1842
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:39,380
They have scouts.

1843
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:44,182
So these scouts will go and find games and they'll find games to publish.

1844
01:38:44,182 --> 01:38:48,443
If you were a scout for a big publisher and you saw a really good game

1845
01:38:48,443 --> 01:38:53,304
and you knew that even without you, it would be successful,

1846
01:38:53,304 --> 01:38:57,765
you might still be incentivized to tell them that they need you

1847
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,366
so that you can get a good deal with them.

1848
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:03,620
And if you get a good deal with them, everyone in your company will like you

1849
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:05,800
because, you know, you did your job as a scout.

1850
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:09,981
Even though at the base level.

1851
01:39:09,981 --> 01:39:12,282
That game didn't really need you as a publisher.

1852
01:39:12,282 --> 01:39:16,883
So so it's it's I think it's like something I've been doing more of

1853
01:39:16,883 --> 01:39:21,524
in the past few years is to think from to try to think from other people's

1854
01:39:21,524 --> 01:39:25,685
perspectives and think about what their motivations, what their incentives might be.

1855
01:39:26,434 --> 01:39:31,380
Just before this, if someone offered help, if a publisher came to me, it's like,

1856
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:35,265
oh, we can help you. You'll just take 30% of your revenue, but we have all the connections

1857
01:39:35,265 --> 01:39:40,472
in the industry, stuff like that. Especially nowadays, you don't really need connections.

1858
01:39:40,472 --> 01:39:42,915
There's a game called Friday Night Funkin', if you know that game.

1859
01:39:43,215 --> 01:39:43,936
It's like a rhythm game.

1860
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:45,116
It's doing really well now.

1861
01:39:45,116 --> 01:39:46,697
It's just started Kickstarter.

1862
01:39:46,697 --> 01:39:47,998
It's made like a million USD.

1863
01:39:47,998 --> 01:39:49,939
They don't have a publisher.

1864
01:39:49,939 --> 01:39:51,260
They didn't need one.

1865
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:52,220
Same for us.

1866
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:56,583
We just uploaded our games to the free demos online.

1867
01:39:56,583 --> 01:39:58,183
And it was the same with them.

1868
01:39:58,183 --> 01:40:00,064
So it just existed as a free demo.

1869
01:40:00,064 --> 01:40:02,666
And usually that kind of thing is more important than having

1870
01:40:02,666 --> 01:40:07,288
someone who knows people, who knows people in Nintendo,

1871
01:40:07,288 --> 01:40:09,189
knows people in Steam and stuff like that.

1872
01:40:09,189 --> 01:40:12,331
That stuff isn't really as important these days.

1873
01:40:13,152 --> 01:40:17,196
as having a direct connection with your audience.

1874
01:40:17,196 --> 01:40:20,519
So in general, if you're offered a publishing deal,

1875
01:40:20,519 --> 01:40:24,663
something that will be really useful is for you to take that

1876
01:40:25,737 --> 01:40:27,738
that offer that they give you.

1877
01:40:27,738 --> 01:40:33,501
And like I was saying earlier, just talk to other more experienced developers

1878
01:40:33,501 --> 01:40:37,763
to advise you on whether it's a fair deal, whether you need them or not.

1879
01:40:37,763 --> 01:40:39,604
So that's what I did when we got publishing offers.

1880
01:40:39,604 --> 01:40:44,267
Luckily, we were in a co-working space where we had more experienced developers

1881
01:40:44,267 --> 01:40:46,108
and I was able to talk to more people and show them.

1882
01:40:46,108 --> 01:40:49,029
They won 50% of our game. Is that normal?

1883
01:40:49,029 --> 01:40:50,670
And they can tell me, no, that's not normal.

1884
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:52,812
That's so ridiculous.

1885
01:40:54,917 --> 01:40:57,758
Yeah, I think that's my two advice.

1886
01:40:57,758 --> 01:41:00,879
Ask people for advice.

1887
01:41:00,879 --> 01:41:03,920
Don't trust publishers.

1888
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:04,740
OK.

1889
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:13,823
So yeah, I guess that's a good spot to end on.

1890
01:41:13,823 --> 01:41:19,245
And I mean, just thank you so much for.

1891
01:41:19,818 --> 01:41:23,559
Willing to spend time and talk to us

1892
01:41:23,559 --> 01:41:29,820
Can I also announce the TGDF thing here?

1893
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:30,581
Yeah sure

1894
01:41:30,581 --> 01:41:33,661
OK yeah so

1895
01:41:33,661 --> 01:41:34,982
就是我

1896
01:41:34,982 --> 01:41:37,682
之前也有邀請他直接來TGDF演講

1897
01:41:37,682 --> 01:41:39,163
對那他在TGDF演講會

1898
01:41:39,163 --> 01:41:42,704
就是目前他是說有空啦

1899
01:41:42,704 --> 01:41:45,144
他應該會比較focus在就是說

1900
01:41:45,144 --> 01:41:48,125
比較具體遊戲設計的細節上面的東西在

1901
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:48,345
TGDF會講比較細這樣

1902
01:41:49,932 --> 01:41:54,196
所以我今天問的問題比較general

1903
01:41:58,947 --> 01:41:59,968
Thank you so much for having us.

1904
01:41:59,968 --> 01:42:01,249
Thank you everyone for coming.

1905
01:42:01,249 --> 01:42:01,609
拍個手,謝謝

1906
01:42:01,609 --> 01:42:02,630
For all your time.

1907
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:04,492
Thanks, we appreciate it.

1908
01:42:04,492 --> 01:42:07,174
Thanks, Johnson, for translating everything.

1909
01:42:07,174 --> 01:42:09,056
I'm actually really impressed that

1910
01:42:09,056 --> 01:42:11,117
you can translate for like five minutes at a time.

1911
01:42:11,117 --> 01:42:16,662
Because like, I probably wouldn't even remember

1912
01:42:16,662 --> 01:42:18,404
like two sentences.

1913
01:42:18,404 --> 01:42:20,806
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I missed some things.

1914
01:42:20,806 --> 01:42:23,749
You've been doing this for 10 years.

1915
01:42:23,749 --> 01:42:24,730
We have recordings, so that's fine.

1916
01:42:25,172 --> 01:42:26,093
Yeah, we have recording.

1917
01:42:26,093 --> 01:42:27,413
We have recording.

1918
01:42:27,413 --> 01:42:27,893
Okay.

1919
01:42:27,893 --> 01:42:28,194
Yeah.

1920
01:42:28,194 --> 01:42:32,996
So if I missed something really important, we can still make up afterwards.

1921
01:42:32,996 --> 01:42:34,456
Oh, I see.

1922
01:42:34,456 --> 01:42:34,697
Okay.

1923
01:42:34,697 --> 01:42:35,357
That's always good to know.

1924
01:42:35,357 --> 01:42:35,577
Okay.

1925
01:42:35,577 --> 01:42:36,557
Thank you, everyone.

1926
01:42:36,557 --> 01:42:37,658
Thanks, Johnson, for having me.

1927
01:42:37,658 --> 01:42:38,318
See you at TGDF, I guess.

1928
01:42:38,318 --> 01:42:39,139
Yeah, see you in July.

1929
01:42:39,139 --> 01:42:39,279
Bye-bye.

1930
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:39,499
Thank you.

1931
01:42:39,499 --> 01:42:39,959
Dun-dun.

1932
01:42:39,959 --> 01:42:40,299
Bye-bye.

1933
01:42:40,299 --> 01:42:40,899
Bye-bye.

1934
01:42:40,899 --> 01:42:41,199
Bye-bye.

1935
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:41,640
Bye-bye.

1936
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:41,760
Bye-bye.

1937
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:42,240

1940
01:42:44,741 --> 01:42:45,501
Bye-bye.

1941
01:42:45,501 --> 01:42:45,942
Bye-bye.
