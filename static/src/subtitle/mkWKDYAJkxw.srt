1
00:00:01,685 --> 00:00:05,948
好,那就很高興大家來參加我們這次六月份的分享會

2
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:10,371
那這次我們就是前半場是先邀請到

3
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:13,813
最近才在台灣開分店的Another Indie

4
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:20,157
這是一個從中國開始的一個Indie Publishing

5
00:00:20,157 --> 00:00:21,778
然後現場應該有一些人已經認識他們了

6
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:24,339
對,那就是他們來介紹一下就是說

7
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:27,702
他們就是整個公司的目前的現況

8
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:28,442
然後他們目前的

9
00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:38,120
Hello everybody, can you hear me?

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,220
Yes.

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:38,801
Okay, perfect.

12
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:43,024
So, first things first, we are another indie.

13
00:00:43,024 --> 00:00:45,827
I'll talk more about this in a moment.

14
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:51,412
And what I want to talk to you today is about dealing with publishers.

15
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:56,797
So I am a video games publisher, and therefore I know how to deal with this.

16
00:00:56,797 --> 00:00:58,318
And we're not always easy.

17
00:00:58,318 --> 00:01:02,662
So, what I want to do today is just kind of like, you are all young.

18
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:07,659
and cute and this may be your first time to deal with a publisher

19
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:12,584
and I want to make sure that you have the understanding, the tools and the

20
00:01:12,584 --> 00:01:14,906
knowledge that you need

21
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:17,409
when entering into those discussions and negotiations, okay?

22
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,254
So I'll keep it light, I'll keep it interesting and fun.

23
00:01:21,254 --> 00:01:23,135
And sorry, my Chinese is very bad.

24
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:24,656
我中文真的非常不好。

25
00:01:24,656 --> 00:01:26,876
So it will be in English.

26
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:29,758
But if you have any questions or anything,

27
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:32,038
I have many wonderful friends here

28
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:34,940
who will help you out understanding later, okay?

29
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,760
And at the end of the talk,

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,782
there'll be lots of time for questions.

31
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:42,303
And if you have a question in Chinese,

32
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:49,542
We have people who can translate, and then they can translate me, so we can all talk no matter what language we speak, okay?

33
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:53,806
Okay. Wonderful. Excellent. So, moving forward.

34
00:01:53,806 --> 00:02:00,872
Okay, so who am I? You probably haven't heard of us. We are a very, very, very small indie game publisher.

35
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:04,635
We've got four team leaders.

36
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:11,679
which is Adria Koresko, who is our CEO, who's that lovely man in the top left.

37
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:16,242
There's me, next to him, with the sunglasses, looking wonderful.

38
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:20,606
And then we have our China operations manager, Eric Lim, who's based in Xiamen,

39
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:23,408
which is where we were based until very recently.

40
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:29,312
And we have this boy here, Vlad, who is our anime character come to life.

41
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:39,532
Another indie, we work predominantly with Asian indie games, and what we do is we help

42
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:42,234
them achieve worldwide success.

43
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:47,017
So we've got games from China, we've got games from the Philippines, from Indonesia, and

44
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:49,359
hopefully soon games from Taiwan.

45
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:55,783
We recently moved 50% of our office to Taiwan, so we are now Taiwan-Ren.

46
00:02:56,355 --> 00:03:01,460
And we're very, very, very excited to be here.

47
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,502
This is month one of Taiwan, so it's very exciting.

48
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:06,904
The food is really good.

49
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:07,305
Okay.

50
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:11,929
So, our most famous game is Lost Castle,

51
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:14,351
which I have to do this because for some reason

52
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:17,153
it doesn't like it when it's in full screen.

53
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:18,575
You might have seen this game.

54
00:03:19,184 --> 00:03:24,048
If you haven't seen this game, don't worry, just lie to me and tell me you have seen this game.

55
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:27,571
And I'll feel much better about it, okay?

56
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:33,677
So this is our breakout hit. We've sold over a million copies of it worldwide.

57
00:03:33,677 --> 00:03:39,582
Predominantly on Steam, but also through some other third-party platforms as well.

58
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:40,803
And we'll be coming on Nintendo Switch.

59
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,304
Very exciting.

60
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:44,706
And some of our other titles...

61
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:45,587
Oh, where's the button?

62
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,863
And some of our other titles you may recognize...

63
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:52,083
Umm...

64
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,785
Come on, you can do it. There we go.

65
00:03:53,785 --> 00:04:00,450
Le Grand Legacy, Sinner Sacrifice Redemption, Nyrish Tower of Shiren and Lost Castle.

66
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:08,756
We have other games, these are just the ones that are like our kind of most famous and ones that are coming out soon.

67
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:10,998
So, go on Steam, wishlist, buy.

68
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:14,461
It's a good idea. It's the summer sale right now, so make some money, make some money.

69
00:04:14,461 --> 00:04:15,902
Taiwan's expensive.

70
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:16,522
Okay, so...

71
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:20,764
Talking to you guys, the first thing that you're going to want to do when you are talking

72
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:23,725
to a publisher is you're going to want to get your pitch sorted.

73
00:04:23,725 --> 00:04:27,927
So your initial introduction is really, really, really important.

74
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:33,490
That first contact, you all know this, you only get one first impression.

75
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,772
This is a very common idea.

76
00:04:35,772 --> 00:04:38,113
Well, a pitch is no different.

77
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:41,715
Nine times out of ten, it is your first impression.

78
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:46,261
What I need you to do is tell me what you want, okay?

79
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:47,522
What you really, really want.

80
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:49,143
Maybe you're all too young for this particular meme.

81
00:04:49,143 --> 00:04:54,006
But, many of you are gonna need or want money, okay?

82
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:58,628
So you need to tell me, how much do you need?

83
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:00,489
What do you need it for?

84
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:03,471
And how are you going to pay it back?

85
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,953
Because, you know, publishers are like a bank.

86
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:08,054
We can happily give you money, but we need to get it back.

87
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:11,976
So, how are you gonna get that money back to us, okay?

88
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:18,019
And what else do you need us to help you out with? Because we're not just banks. Publishers

89
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:24,423
are service providers. So we can do a lot of things to help you complete your game.

90
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:30,186
So think about it. Before you start talking to publishers, before you start sending out

91
00:05:30,186 --> 00:05:35,530
emails, have a really good idea. Do you need help with porting? Or can you do that yourself?

92
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,933
Do you need your game localised? Do you have somebody on your staff who speaks amazing

93
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:40,253
English?

94
00:05:40,613 --> 00:05:46,378
Can you do simplified Chinese, can you do German, French, all the other big languages?

95
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:49,381
Do you need any assistance with development?

96
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:52,964
Do you have any weak points in your development team that you need filled in?

97
00:05:54,637 --> 00:06:00,679
Quality assurance. How good is your QA team? As small first-time developers, your QA team

98
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:05,360
is probably not that good. So that's something that you're going to want to talk to the publisher

99
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,482
about. And international showcasing. One of the big reasons why you get a publisher is

100
00:06:10,482 --> 00:06:16,865
to get that international recognition, so that when people go to PAX, when they go to

101
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:20,286
Gamescom, they see your games, right?

102
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:29,665
So you need to have a really, really, really good idea about what you want before you even start talking to publishers.

103
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:31,826
Okay? Very, very, very important.

104
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:36,767
The number of people that I get in my email, that send me emails saying,

105
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:40,889
Hey! I have a cool game!

106
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:41,529
Wonderful.

107
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:48,037
Like, we need a lot more information than that before we can even start to make that

108
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:49,058
conversation happen.

109
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:54,900
So the more information you can give me, the quicker you can give it to me, the happier

110
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,801
I am going to be.

111
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:58,062
Okay?

112
00:06:58,062 --> 00:07:03,264
One of the first things that I tell people to do is to sort out their elevator pitch.

113
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:05,185
Do you know what an elevator pitch is?

114
00:07:06,128 --> 00:07:11,911
An elevator pitch is a one or two sentence description of your project.

115
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:17,434
And if you cannot describe your project in one or two sentences, you need to think really

116
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:18,875
hard about your project.

117
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:24,398
Because the more difficult it is to describe, the more difficult it is for people to get

118
00:07:24,398 --> 00:07:24,978
excited about.

119
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:25,999
Okay?

120
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:31,862
So, here's a few examples of games that we've done, that we've worked on the elevator

121
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:32,122
pitch.

122
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:34,803
So, Shots Fired, which is...

123
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:43,258
this game over here which is a visual novel with adventure game elements and it's all

124
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:47,524
about hide and seek and murder. Okay? So, how do we describe it? So, Shots Fired is

125
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:50,808
the world's first FPS.

126
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:58,393
First-person assassination simulator. So from this sentence you know immediately that this game is funny, right?

127
00:07:58,393 --> 00:07:59,114
FPS

128
00:07:59,114 --> 00:07:59,854
You know

129
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:04,998
Anybody who's an English speaker is going to go. Oh, there is there is humor to this game

130
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:06,539
Which is a really big part of it

131
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:12,983
You know that it's a first-person game and you know that it's got assassination as the main core mechanic

132
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:17,566
So you've actually managed to deliver an awful lot of information in one sentence

133
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:20,348
Yuppie Psycho, I think is even better.

134
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:24,932
Um, a first day, first job survival horror.

135
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:25,733
Wow, what does that look like?

136
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:30,797
Like, you know, you're going, oh yeah, we all know this.

137
00:08:30,797 --> 00:08:33,600
First day, first job, oh scary.

138
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,722
Survival horror.

139
00:08:35,722 --> 00:08:37,023
Resident Evil in an office?

140
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,940
It makes people interested.

141
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,862
Now our third one is an example of a not so good one.

142
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:46,664
So this was one from when we were just starting out,

143
00:08:46,664 --> 00:08:48,566
and we hadn't quite nailed it.

144
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:53,090
So join a race of sentient vegetables

145
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:58,334
on their sci-fi roguelike adventure to save the world.

146
00:08:58,334 --> 00:08:59,755
There's too much here.

147
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:02,738
It's not as snappy, it's not as quick.

148
00:09:02,738 --> 00:09:03,678
The idea of an elevator pitch

149
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:06,020
is that if you end up in an elevator,

150
00:09:06,353 --> 00:09:10,717
with somebody and they go, ah, what's your game?

151
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,079
You can tell them before that elevator reaches its destination.

152
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:19,123
So that's the idea, is that sometimes when you're at these meetings,

153
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:23,827
when you're going to Taipei game show, you will meet people for very short periods of

154
00:09:23,827 --> 00:09:24,707
time

155
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:28,770
and being able to express what your game is

156
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,773
in 10 seconds is an incredibly powerful tool.

157
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,271
So work on that, it's a really important first step.

158
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:38,471
Now, the next thing is when you're sending me a pitch.

159
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:42,352
Okay, so we talked a little bit about this before,

160
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:46,554
like what I want you guys to prepare for yourselves.

161
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:51,135
Now this is about what I want you to send to me.

162
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:54,316
Okay, so when you are introducing yourself,

163
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:54,996
what do I want?

164
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:58,237
This is the most boring slide that I have.

165
00:09:58,237 --> 00:09:59,958
It's very long, so bear with me.

166
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,199
The number one thing, the number.

167
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:11,206
Okay? You would be amazed how many people send me,

168
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:14,546
hey I have a really cool game, I need a million dollars.

169
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:16,387
Can I see the game?

170
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:21,188
Like, it's quite important to me to make decisions, you know,

171
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:25,549
and so many people don't send a build of a game.

172
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:29,529
If you do not have a working playable build of your game,

173
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,830
you are not ready to be pitching to publishers.

174
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,810
Unless you are Bungie.

175
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:37,947
If you're a bungee, you can do whatever the hell you like.

176
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:41,889
But everybody else, you've got to have

177
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:45,651
something that I can play. I also want a gameplay video.

178
00:10:45,651 --> 00:10:50,913
Because the first thing I'm going to do if there's a gameplay video in the email

179
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:55,535
is I'm going to watch it. And that will help inform what I do next.

180
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:59,477
So a build and a gameplay video. Another thing I want to know is who you are.

181
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,342
How many people do you have on your team?

182
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:03,643
What's your past experience?

183
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:05,967
Do you have any projects that I should know about?

184
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:06,548
Who are you?

185
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:07,849
What is your skill?

186
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:09,472
Where did you go to university?

187
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:10,693
Why are you making this game?

188
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:14,619
All of these things are really, really, really important.

189
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:17,383
And the more information I have about the team, the better.

190
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,491
And of course, about the game.

191
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:22,813
Like, what is this game about?

192
00:11:22,813 --> 00:11:25,675
What is special about your game?

193
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:28,157
If you have a game that's a 2D platformer,

194
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:31,339
you need to tell me why your 2D platformer is special

195
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,721
because there are many, many, many, many, many

196
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:36,083
2D platformers, okay?

197
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,124
So it's all about you expressing to me

198
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:41,487
as quickly as possible how much,

199
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:43,768
why I should be interested in your game.

200
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:45,870
Of course, what do you need?

201
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,892
We talked about that before.

202
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,003
Tell me in that pitch. Don't hide it and be secret.

203
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,564
Ooh, I need help. Ooh.

204
00:11:53,564 --> 00:11:59,468
We get this a lot. People being very shy about telling me what they need.

205
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,751
Don't be shy. If you need money, tell me you need money.

206
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:05,052
If you need QA, tell me you need QA.

207
00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:09,456
The more information I have at that first stage, the better.

208
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:12,258
Explain why I should like this game.

209
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:15,060
How does your game fit into my company?

210
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:19,255
Show knowledge of the people that you are writing to.

211
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:23,116
For example, if you're sending an email to Devolver Digital,

212
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:25,196
you all know Devolver Digital, I hope,

213
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:27,917
they have really good games across a wide gamut.

214
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:32,298
Explain how your game fits into their catalogue.

215
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:33,598
Okay?

216
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:36,099
And very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

217
00:12:36,099 --> 00:12:38,599
very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

218
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:43,620
very important, don't copy and paste to everyone.

219
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:47,300
Because we all talk to each other.

220
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,081
We all know each other.

221
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:57,145
So if we all get the exact same identical copy and paste, we know about it very very

222
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:57,505
quickly.

223
00:12:57,505 --> 00:13:05,128
Of course big chunks will be the same, but if it's just, dear, insert publisher name

224
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:07,870
here, I have game da da da da da da da da da da da da.

225
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,233
we know, we can tell immediately what is happening

226
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:16,316
and it just doesn't look very professional. If you're approaching somebody

227
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:19,518
asking to do business with them, you make sure that email is

228
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:23,701
personal to them. It's really important.

229
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:28,425
Now, here I have an example of a very, very, very, very, very good pitch.

230
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:29,506
Okay?

231
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:34,850
I'll give you a copy of all this afterwards so you don't need to panic about this.

232
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,531
But this is an example of a really, really, really good pitch.

233
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:42,532
So you can see at the beginning they

234
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:46,193
introduce who they are, where they're from, and they also introduce

235
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:50,354
how they know me. Like, hey, we saw your games at PAX East.

236
00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:55,716
They look cool. Maybe it's fang pi, but it makes me feel good.

237
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:58,256
Okay? It's like, hey, I know who you are.

238
00:13:58,256 --> 00:13:58,857
It's good.

239
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:02,622
it creates a rapport, okay? They then have a

240
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:07,025
description of the game here, which I've taken out because the game isn't finished yet,

241
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:08,807
so I don't want anyone to see it just yet,

242
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:13,951
and they give us all of this information that we need.

243
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:16,052
We get screenshots, key art, a 90 second

244
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:19,095
playable video, a playable demo,

245
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:23,338
and a full playthrough video as well. So we get

246
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:26,280
everything I need, right there, in that one little...

247
00:14:27,254 --> 00:14:30,335
five bullet points, I have everything I need to go

248
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:34,918
oh, this game is interesting or this game is not interesting.

249
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:38,499
And then they explain who they are.

250
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:41,081
Hi, we are these people, we made this,

251
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:45,163
here are some past projects, here are things that we're doing that's very special,

252
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:45,803
we're working with

253
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,104
specific people.

254
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:53,516
It's a very, very, very good sound pitch and as Vlad will tell you, this was a pitch that

255
00:14:53,516 --> 00:14:57,279
I went, this is interesting, I need to get the rest of the team to look at it.

256
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,140
And that's what you want.

257
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,322
You want somebody like us.

258
00:15:01,322 --> 00:15:07,746
In the end, you're talking to one person and that one person will make a decision as to

259
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:11,249
whether your game goes forward or whether it stays where it is.

260
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:14,011
So you really need to impress that one person.

261
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:15,252
So that's it for that section.

262
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:20,763
The next one is about who do you think you're talking to.

263
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:29,467
So, there are lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of games publishers out there.

264
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:35,130
Another indie, we specifically work with PC and console games.

265
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:41,913
So if you have a mobile game, we are probably not the right people to talk to,

266
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:44,214
but if you approach us in the right way, like,

267
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:44,614
Hey!

268
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:49,684
So for example, if you are working on a mobile game, and you want some advice, and you send

269
00:15:49,684 --> 00:15:55,807
me an email saying, Hi Ian, I saw you in Taipei, and I have a mobile game.

270
00:15:55,807 --> 00:16:01,149
Would you be able to give me some advice, and possibly help me get introduced to people

271
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:01,609
who can help me?

272
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:05,371
I'm probably going to say, yeah sure.

273
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:09,773
You came to the talk, you listened to what I said, and most importantly, you know that

274
00:16:09,773 --> 00:16:13,535
my company doesn't do this, but you've asked for assistance anyway.

275
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:19,336
You've shown knowledge, you've shown research, I will go an extra step to help you out.

276
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:24,779
If you just send me a copy and paste email saying, I have a mobile game, I'm just going

277
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:29,861
to send a response saying, sorry, we don't deal with mobile games.

278
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:36,385
So it's all about, once you have those connections, use those connections, even if they aren't

279
00:16:36,385 --> 00:16:39,107
the perfect connection, they can help you.

280
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:44,221
and we'll talk more about that later. These are just a very, very, very, very, very small

281
00:16:44,221 --> 00:16:49,549
smattering of publishers. 505, if you have a kind of mid-tier publisher,

282
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:54,775
Sinner style indie game, you should maybe be talking to someone like 505.

283
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:59,417
If you have something bright and colourful and crazy, Devolver might be the people to

284
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:00,238
talk to.

285
00:17:00,238 --> 00:17:05,920
If you have a mobile game that's really suitable for China, then TapTap are great people.

286
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,603
If you have something crazy, cute and multiplayer, then Tiny Build might be the people to talk

287
00:17:11,603 --> 00:17:11,643
to.

288
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:16,666
Every publisher has their own kind of unique brand and that's something that you're going

289
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:17,066
to want to...

290
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:20,728
at least have some knowledge of when you're doing the pitch.

291
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:29,313
Like I said before, explain why that publisher should like your games.

292
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:29,453
Now,

293
00:17:29,453 --> 00:17:31,214
due diligence.

294
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:34,456
Do you guys know what due diligence means?

295
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:38,179
Due diligence means check your shit, okay?

296
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:41,180
Every time someone sends you an email, check it.

297
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,742
Don't believe everything that you are told,

298
00:17:43,742 --> 00:17:47,404
especially as you are young and innocent and people will want to eat you.

299
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:56,536
So, there are a lot of very, very, very sketchy, very dodgy publishers out there.

300
00:17:56,536 --> 00:17:58,998
Not everyone is as nice and kind as me.

301
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:08,784
Many people are not. So you need to not only be checking out yourself, you need to be checking out the people who you are talking to.

302
00:18:08,784 --> 00:18:17,389
So who are they? Who is this publisher that's contacted you? What are their goals? What type of games are they interested in?

303
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:20,310
And most importantly, why do they want your games?

304
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:24,194
You know, why do they think your game fits them?

305
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:26,976
It's a two-way conversation.

306
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:30,979
It's not just about you trying to convince them,

307
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:32,660
it's about them trying to convince you, okay?

308
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,382
So don't get into this power dynamic

309
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:40,225
where you think you are beholden to the publisher

310
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:42,107
because that's not how it works anymore.

311
00:18:42,107 --> 00:18:46,870
That's how it used to work, but we're all poor now, so.

312
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,171
So.

313
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:53,487
If you are talking to a publisher and you like these guys, you think, hey, this is a

314
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:58,249
good idea, this looks good, they are interested in the game, they're cool people, what do

315
00:18:58,249 --> 00:18:59,309
I want to do next?

316
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:02,511
You want to talk to other developers who worked with them.

317
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:07,593
You will learn more from other developers than you will learn from the publisher.

318
00:19:07,593 --> 00:19:08,953
I say that as the publisher.

319
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:18,322
One of the first things I always do when we are talking to a new game is I give them the contact information of other games that have worked with us.

320
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:20,104
And not just Lost Castle.

321
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:23,569
Because obviously Lost Castle sold a million copies.

322
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:25,171
They fucking love us.

323
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:29,678
You know, they're like a million copies, yeeeaaah, that's a lot of money.

324
00:19:29,678 --> 00:19:32,018
So they have a very positive experience.

325
00:19:32,018 --> 00:19:35,099
We have other games that have sold well, but not as well.

326
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:37,800
And we have some games that haven't sold that well.

327
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,561
And those people you need to speak to too.

328
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:47,683
You need to make sure that the people that you're speaking to are not just...

329
00:19:47,683 --> 00:19:48,103
fang pi.

330
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:51,754
You need to make sure they're not bullshitting you.

331
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:53,975
And the only people who can tell you for sure

332
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,977
are people that they have worked with in the past.

333
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:58,878
Another thing you need to know is

334
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:03,241
who is your point of contact at this company, okay?

335
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:05,142
You need one person,

336
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:09,384
one person who is the person that you will talk to.

337
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:15,882
So, whether it's me, whether it's Vlad, whether it's Dawn, whether it's Frank, somebody needs

338
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,684
to be your point of contact.

339
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:22,448
So when you have a problem with your game, you contact that person.

340
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:26,931
You do not want to be emailing info at anotherindie.com.

341
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:30,214
You want to be emailing Ian at anotherindie.com.

342
00:20:30,214 --> 00:20:32,176
You do not want a generic contact, okay?

343
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:37,780
Because having that personal connection is really, really, really, really important.

344
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:46,118
And if something seems wrong, if you're talking to a publisher and there's something not right

345
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:50,679
about it, something is probably wrong.

346
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:51,919
Trust your gut.

347
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:58,621
If you are talking to people and everything they say sounds too good to be true, it probably

348
00:20:58,621 --> 00:20:59,881
is too good to be true.

349
00:20:59,881 --> 00:21:02,702
Don't believe the hype.

350
00:21:02,702 --> 00:21:07,083
And follows on very nicely, the hype is too damn high.

351
00:21:08,237 --> 00:21:15,299
It is 2018 now, and 2018, the games industry is brutal.

352
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:20,100
It is a battle royale out there for video games.

353
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,141
And anybody who tells you differently is not telling you the truth.

354
00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:26,501
Base your research.

355
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:33,423
So when you are looking at your game, and you are figuring out how many copies will my game sell,

356
00:21:34,384 --> 00:21:39,207
You need to be looking at very, very recent examples.

357
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:50,215
I have so many, many people who send me a pitch for video games, and they say,

358
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:53,457
My video game will sell 300,000 copies in the first month.

359
00:21:53,457 --> 00:21:55,999
And I say,

360
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:57,600
How do you know that?

361
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,643
Well, I did research on a game that came out in 2012.

362
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:09,058
And in 2012, this game said yes, because in 2012, there were only two games a day on Steam.

363
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:13,481
Now, there are 30 to 50 games a day on Steam.

364
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:19,325
It's a lot more difficult to sell copies of your game in 2018 than it was in 2012.

365
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:21,787
And you need to be aware of that.

366
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:28,352
When you are researching, you need to be using recent, modern...

367
00:22:28,688 --> 00:22:33,670
examples. Do not fall into the trap of looking at other people's 10-year-old successes, because

368
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:41,574
it's not the same industry anymore. When you're looking at those numbers as well, make sure...

369
00:22:41,574 --> 00:22:49,798
because here's a problem. We all use Steam Spy, or some equivalent, App Annie, etc, etc.

370
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:53,880
When you are using things like Steam Spy, you have to be careful, because Steam Spy

371
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,782
does not do a good job of differentiating games that were sold...

372
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:01,805
at 100% price, and games that were sold at 90% price.

373
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:06,246
Or games that were sold in bundles. So you can have

374
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:09,727
very, very high numbers, but actually the game

375
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:13,448
says, oh, this game sold for $30.

376
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:14,768
$30, 300,000 copies. Nice.

377
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:19,449
Good money, yeah. But then you look into it, and actually

378
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:22,990
all of these 250,000 copies of this game

379
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,450
were sold at 95% discount.

380
00:23:26,762 --> 00:23:29,564
And suddenly, it's not quite as exciting.

381
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:33,746
And this is really, really common in the industry today.

382
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:39,288
So make sure you're being very, very, very careful.

383
00:23:39,288 --> 00:23:41,870
And all the tools that you need to check this exist.

384
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,551
But you have to do your research.

385
00:23:44,551 --> 00:23:48,973
Anybody who promises you success, if they say, no

386
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:52,475
problem, your game's going to make a billion dollars, they

387
00:23:52,475 --> 00:23:53,255
are lying.

388
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:59,501
They are lying because there is no guarantee success anymore.

389
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:04,864
The only way that your game is guaranteed to make a billion dollars is if the publisher

390
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,946
will give you a billion dollars.

391
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:12,510
And if the publisher offers you a billion dollars, you say, yes, absolutely.

392
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:18,528
But that is literally the only way that is guaranteed to happen, and you need to be aware of that.

393
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:25,993
Because I have been in this situation before, and I have spoken to indie developers who were told lies.

394
00:24:25,993 --> 00:24:33,358
And they end up signing a contract, believing what they've been told, and they end up losing out.

395
00:24:33,358 --> 00:24:37,161
The publisher does not, but they end up losing out.

396
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:40,443
Okay? So it's really important to check that stuff.

397
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:45,481
Always listen to a publisher's research. It's what we're good at.

398
00:24:45,481 --> 00:24:50,905
But, always check it. Always make sure, like, okay,

399
00:24:50,905 --> 00:24:56,049
does this make sense? Can I prove that this is true? Not just believe that what

400
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:57,010
they said is true,

401
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:00,052
but prove that it is true. And if

402
00:25:00,052 --> 00:25:05,176
they predict that your game sales are really high, ask them,

403
00:25:05,176 --> 00:25:09,039
why do you think this? Don't get excited because somebody says,

404
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,040
I've been there. I was young once.

405
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,471
It's very easy to get excited when people say,

406
00:25:15,471 --> 00:25:18,272
I love your game, it's gonna make a million dollars.

407
00:25:18,272 --> 00:25:20,593
But you need to find out why do they think

408
00:25:20,593 --> 00:25:22,433
your game will make a million dollars.

409
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:26,095
What is making them excited about this title?

410
00:25:26,095 --> 00:25:27,475
Really, really important.

411
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:30,576
And for you guys, just generally,

412
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:34,778
be realistic, be optimistic, but be cautious.

413
00:25:34,778 --> 00:25:39,840
Don't get too excited, don't spend five years

414
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,300
making your first game.

415
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:49,312
don't fall into traps that have been well documented in the industry before.

416
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,053
And here is the best way to avoid doing that.

417
00:25:52,053 --> 00:26:00,615
Reach out to the community. The gaming community is not that big.

418
00:26:00,615 --> 00:26:06,897
You know, there are maybe 10,000 active people in the gaming community who are active.

419
00:26:07,213 --> 00:26:11,295
you know, who are selling products, who are out there, who are

420
00:26:11,295 --> 00:26:14,617
first-hand experience selling games. It's not

421
00:26:14,617 --> 00:26:17,599
that difficult to have international

422
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:21,321
knowledge from these people. And most of them

423
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:25,023
are very, very, very, very, very, very, very willing to share.

424
00:26:25,023 --> 00:26:27,784
Okay? So make friends.

425
00:26:27,784 --> 00:26:34,688
I tell this to everybody, get on Twitter. Now I know in Taiwan, Twitter is not very

426
00:26:34,688 --> 00:26:35,489
big.

427
00:26:35,489 --> 00:26:36,009
I know this.

428
00:26:36,248 --> 00:26:40,029
But internationally, Twitter is the game dev chat.

429
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:46,791
It's how game developers talk to each other, it's how they share their latest news, it's

430
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:51,052
how they share the things that went well, the things that went bad.

431
00:26:51,052 --> 00:26:57,254
And following the right people and talking to the right people on that platform is incredibly

432
00:26:57,254 --> 00:26:57,474
useful.

433
00:26:57,474 --> 00:26:59,134
We have signed games because of Twitter.

434
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:04,916
And we have found opportunities for hundreds of thousands of US dollars because of Twitter.

435
00:27:06,016 --> 00:27:10,257
because that's where people are talking about what they are doing

436
00:27:10,257 --> 00:27:14,659
and that's the most valuable thing that you can have. So if you do not have a Twitter account

437
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:17,940
and you want to make and sell games, you should have a Twitter account.

438
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:24,182
And you should be networking, you should be sharing what you are doing, you should be chatting,

439
00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:27,483
all of this stuff. Facebook, very useful,

440
00:27:27,483 --> 00:27:30,324
Twitter is currently king.

441
00:27:33,481 --> 00:27:36,402
Now, the art of not getting fucked.

442
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:44,265
So, how to enter the games industry, how to deal with publishers, and how to not end up feeling very sad at the end of it.

443
00:27:44,265 --> 00:27:48,486
This is my longest and most boring slide.

444
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:51,527
So, everything comes down to contracts.

445
00:27:51,527 --> 00:27:54,068
Yay, contracts.

446
00:27:54,068 --> 00:27:56,249
I spend about half my life writing contracts.

447
00:27:56,249 --> 00:27:56,669
It's great fun.

448
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:57,189
There is, uh...

449
00:27:57,189 --> 00:28:01,430
I'll tell you this right now, there is no such thing as a...

450
00:28:09,432 --> 00:28:14,775
There's always two parties involved in a contract, so there's always going to be give and take.

451
00:28:14,775 --> 00:28:17,877
But, there are still some things that you should be looking at.

452
00:28:17,877 --> 00:28:25,681
You should, as developers, you should be looking at minimum guarantees and recoup percentages immediately.

453
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:31,424
These two things at the top, if you don't know what they mean, look into them, because they will be very important to your future.

454
00:28:31,424 --> 00:28:34,485
A minimum guarantee is when the publishing says,

455
00:28:34,485 --> 00:28:38,908
I guarantee that your game will sell X amount, therefore, here's the money now.

456
00:28:41,248 --> 00:28:45,632
We like minimum guarantees. Minimum guarantees are good. It's money.

457
00:28:45,632 --> 00:28:48,274
Recoup percentages are what the publisher

458
00:28:48,274 --> 00:28:52,658
brings back. So for example, if I say I will spend

459
00:28:52,658 --> 00:28:56,302
$10,000 on marketing your game, okay?

460
00:28:56,302 --> 00:29:01,026
When I recoup, that means I take that money back

461
00:29:01,026 --> 00:29:03,428
before you get your money. So if your game

462
00:29:03,428 --> 00:29:05,690
only makes $10,000, you don't make any money.

463
00:29:06,985 --> 00:29:12,226
So you need to look into that, and you need to make sure that what's being presented to

464
00:29:12,226 --> 00:29:18,347
you makes sense, and that you're confident that you're going to make money.

465
00:29:18,347 --> 00:29:21,308
To the end of the day, if you don't make money, you don't make any more games.

466
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:23,948
And that's sad for everybody.

467
00:29:23,948 --> 00:29:27,509
Nothing should be in the contract that isn't relevant to you.

468
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:29,970
Now most contracts are copy-paste.

469
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:33,570
You know, you have a thousand contracts, so you copy-paste, and then you fiddle with them,

470
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,290
you fix them.

471
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,463
for the individuals. But that does mean that sometimes you end up with things in contracts

472
00:29:39,463 --> 00:29:44,526
that don't necessarily apply to you. Things about, for example, you're making a single

473
00:29:44,526 --> 00:29:50,769
player game, but inside the contract it has things about multiplayer. You want to make

474
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:57,193
sure that you get all of that shit out. Anything that's not appropriate to your game should

475
00:29:57,193 --> 00:30:00,755
not be in the contract. Because this just leads to problems in the future.

476
00:30:01,303 --> 00:30:09,430
Especially when you're rolling over or if you're bringing in new games from the IP, you need to make sure that the contract is your contract.

477
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,372
There's nothing extra in there.

478
00:30:11,372 --> 00:30:14,494
Sorry, this is really boring. I am aware. I'm really sorry.

479
00:30:14,494 --> 00:30:18,278
And protect your rights, okay?

480
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:24,223
You are the game developer, so you need to figure out what you want to keep.

481
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:27,045
Many publishers will want your game's IP.

482
00:30:28,312 --> 00:30:30,194
or at least a percentage of your game's IP.

483
00:30:30,194 --> 00:30:35,058
So what this means is, if you make Super Mario the next one,

484
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:39,041
it doesn't matter if you go with a different publisher for Super Mario 2,

485
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:42,584
the original publisher still owns a percentage of it.

486
00:30:42,584 --> 00:30:47,147
So if you get a good deal, this isn't a bad thing.

487
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:51,491
But if you get an okay deal, where you sign away your entire IP,

488
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:52,111
holy shit!

489
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:59,791
you know, that can be a really, really, really, really damaging, painful, painful thing.

490
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:04,672
You also want to make sure who can organize bundles and who can organize discounts.

491
00:31:04,672 --> 00:31:13,393
Because there are thousands of horror stories out there of your game, it's a good game,

492
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:17,414
sells for $10, but in the first month it doesn't sell enough copies.

493
00:31:17,414 --> 00:31:22,335
So your publisher panics and he starts selling your game for $1.

494
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:28,309
So suddenly, instead of getting 70% of $9, you're getting 70% of $1.

495
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:31,171
You're getting 70 cents per game, not including tax.

496
00:31:31,171 --> 00:31:37,415
It gets very low very, very quick. And this happens a lot.

497
00:31:37,415 --> 00:31:45,760
There are so many horror stories of publishers doing this, of publishers having the right...

498
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:50,633
to just slash the value of a game and sell as many copies as possible as quickly as possible.

499
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:56,977
Basically, dumping and running. You need to make sure that that doesn't happen,

500
00:31:56,977 --> 00:32:03,362
because that's not fun for anybody. Be realistic about your expectations within the contract.

501
00:32:03,362 --> 00:32:10,908
If you are expecting huge amounts of money, a large MG, be expecting to give things away.

502
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:16,076
If you are not expecting that, then you should be

503
00:32:16,076 --> 00:32:19,578
haggling hard and making sure that you get the best deal possible.

504
00:32:19,578 --> 00:32:22,539
And the final one is

505
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:27,301
get the contract checked by a lawyer. It's expensive.

506
00:32:27,301 --> 00:32:30,462
Lawyers aren't cheap and nobody likes them.

507
00:32:30,462 --> 00:32:35,625
But, understanding contracts is hard

508
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:39,106
and it's really easy to make a mistake.

509
00:32:39,106 --> 00:32:40,967
I say this as someone who has made mistakes.

510
00:32:41,757 --> 00:32:44,257
So get a lawyer to check your contract.

511
00:32:44,257 --> 00:32:44,397
Okay?

512
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:44,777
Okay?

513
00:32:44,777 --> 00:32:46,717
And take your time.

514
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:53,539
When somebody presents you with a contract,

515
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:55,659
you don't have to sign it that day.

516
00:32:55,659 --> 00:32:56,239
You should say,

517
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:59,020
I need to take at least a week

518
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,300
to look at this, to think about this,

519
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,601
to turn it over in your head,

520
00:33:04,601 --> 00:33:08,561
because once that contract is signed,

521
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:09,042
it's done.

522
00:33:09,976 --> 00:33:13,958
There's no going back, that's the point of a contract.

523
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:17,900
So take your time, don't get too excited,

524
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,001
do what you gotta do.

525
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:24,043
And this is the most important thing

526
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:27,425
about working with a publisher, do you trust them?

527
00:33:27,425 --> 00:33:31,627
Do you trust these people?

528
00:33:31,627 --> 00:33:35,989
And if the answer is even a little bit no,

529
00:33:35,989 --> 00:33:37,390
if it's even a little bit,

530
00:33:40,106 --> 00:33:50,456
Don't do it. Because a publishing deal is the beginning of a relationship that will last for years.

531
00:33:50,456 --> 00:33:54,780
We are still dealing with all of our games for the last four years.

532
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,204
That's longer than any of my relationships.

533
00:33:58,204 --> 00:34:02,448
Like, there are marriages that don't last that long.

534
00:34:02,448 --> 00:34:04,510
So you need to make sure...

535
00:34:07,874 --> 00:34:11,556
You can deal with these people for four years at least of your life.

536
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:17,000
And I mean talking with them every other day, calling them once a week.

537
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,803
You will talk to your publisher more than you talk to your mother.

538
00:34:20,803 --> 00:34:21,203
Okay?

539
00:34:21,203 --> 00:34:22,744
So be ready for that.

540
00:34:22,744 --> 00:34:26,787
Make sure that you can deal with that.

541
00:34:26,787 --> 00:34:31,249
Because if you can't, then these are not the people that you need to be talking to.

542
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:32,190
Just simple as that.

543
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:37,213
And now it's just time for some opinions.

544
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:43,757
my steaming hot takes. That's all the important stuff finished so we can relax a little bit now.

545
00:34:43,757 --> 00:34:51,458
So, you guys are mostly young. Finish your game. Whatever it is you are working on,

546
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:59,360
whatever idea you have, finish it. Because your first game is not going to make you all the money

547
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:05,501
in the world. Do not think, I have the most amazing idea for a game, it will take me so

548
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:07,001
long to develop but it will be awesome.

549
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:14,478
It won't work. You need the experience. You need to learn. You need to be in the industry.

550
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:19,641
You need to figure out how to do things like budget. And the only way you figure that stuff

551
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:28,387
out is by doing it. So set a reasonable goal. I will make my first game in six months. And

552
00:35:28,387 --> 00:35:34,011
then it doesn't matter if you make a lot of money off it, because once you have a game

553
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:37,133
and it's out there, you're a developer.

554
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:40,431
I can Google your name and I can find your game.

555
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:43,013
And that's important.

556
00:35:43,013 --> 00:35:47,897
As young people coming into the games industry, the most important thing that you can have

557
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:49,919
is a believable resume.

558
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:54,703
Is experience and proof of that experience.

559
00:35:54,703 --> 00:35:59,187
So being able to say, look, here's a game, it's cool, right?

560
00:35:59,187 --> 00:36:01,349
Is the first step.

561
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:04,972
A great example of this was I was speaking to a guy at GDC just last year.

562
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:10,119
he had this really cool smash bros style game

563
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:12,319
but it was about fish in a fish tank

564
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:16,981
so there were two fish fighting each other and they had to knock each other out of the tank

565
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:18,841
super cool little game

566
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:19,301
really nice

567
00:36:19,301 --> 00:36:20,422
and he was like

568
00:36:20,422 --> 00:36:22,662
i don't know what to do with it

569
00:36:22,662 --> 00:36:24,363
because it's not good enough

570
00:36:24,363 --> 00:36:25,583
to be like

571
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,283
a big game

572
00:36:27,397 --> 00:36:40,040
But, it's done. You know what I mean? Like, I could spend another year on it, and make it, and give 20 fish, and a thousand bowls, and you know, do all sorts of cool stuff.

573
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:52,283
And I said, don't do that. It's cool, it's fun. Stick it up on itch.io tomorrow, charge a dollar for it, and start your next thing.

574
00:36:53,317 --> 00:36:58,441
And he ended up getting a job, because somebody saw his game.

575
00:36:58,441 --> 00:36:59,862
He said, that's a cool game.

576
00:36:59,862 --> 00:37:02,264
This guy understands fighting mechanics.

577
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:03,505
I'm making a fighting game.

578
00:37:03,505 --> 00:37:05,687
He's young.

579
00:37:05,687 --> 00:37:06,047
He's cheap.

580
00:37:06,047 --> 00:37:06,447
Off he went.

581
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:12,192
And that's what you need to be doing.

582
00:37:12,192 --> 00:37:16,015
You need to be thinking very, very, very economically,

583
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:19,178
because trying to do your biggest game...

584
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:28,340
in your first few years is the most lethal thing you can do.

585
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:36,683
And I know so many developers who are no longer developers because this is what they did.

586
00:37:36,683 --> 00:37:44,526
They spent three years trying to create this idea of a game that's just beyond them right

587
00:37:44,526 --> 00:37:44,686
now.

588
00:37:44,686 --> 00:37:47,927
It comes out, it's not good, or worst of all, it never comes out.

589
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:48,407
And so don't do it.

590
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:56,291
make your game, finish your game. It's never too early to start self-promotion.

591
00:37:56,291 --> 00:38:00,252
So by self-promotion what I mean is promoting yourself.

592
00:38:00,252 --> 00:38:05,573
Showing the cool things that you've done. If you're a university student and you made

593
00:38:05,573 --> 00:38:08,534
university projects that you can put up on itch.io for free, do it.

594
00:38:08,534 --> 00:38:13,115
Get yourself out there, get information about yourself.

595
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:21,494
Get on Reset Era, get on every gaming forum you can get your little hands on and just

596
00:38:21,494 --> 00:38:23,695
talk about what it is you're doing.

597
00:38:23,695 --> 00:38:25,876
Because that's how it works these days.

598
00:38:25,876 --> 00:38:30,559
If you are not actively self-promoting, there is 20 other people who are.

599
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:32,400
And they will get your job.

600
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:40,744
So get out there, show people what you're doing, because we want to see it.

601
00:38:41,326 --> 00:38:43,488
and join every event you can.

602
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,610
Things like this are so important

603
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:51,336
because you don't know who's going to be there.

604
00:38:51,336 --> 00:38:54,319
This week you are very unlucky because it's me

605
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:56,161
and I'm not very important,

606
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:58,083
but you don't know who's going to come.

607
00:38:58,748 --> 00:39:02,731
The game development community moves around a lot.

608
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:06,914
So you will find people come from China to Taipei on holiday

609
00:39:06,914 --> 00:39:09,716
and they go, oh, there's a meeting at the ITDA,

610
00:39:09,716 --> 00:39:11,977
I'll go and attend things like that.

611
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:14,019
These things are super important

612
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,640
because you don't know who you're gonna meet

613
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,422
and everybody is somebody.

614
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:22,164
Like somebody that you meet here today,

615
00:39:22,164 --> 00:39:23,985
they might be the head of EA in 20 years time.

616
00:39:24,627 --> 00:39:27,349
And then you get to go, hey, remember that time we were at IGDA?

617
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:30,270
What? We listened to that crazy foreigner?

618
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,511
Yeah, it was good, huh? Got a job?

619
00:39:32,511 --> 00:39:35,553
It's all super important.

620
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:38,474
So that's my hot takes.

621
00:39:38,474 --> 00:39:44,577
Now, I'm going to open it up to you guys and let you know if you have any questions.

622
00:39:44,577 --> 00:39:50,280
If you have questions and you don't want to put your hand up or you're shy, don't be shy, but if you are shy,

623
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,602
you can tweet me, Twitter, or you can email me.

624
00:39:53,997 --> 00:39:58,220
old school. Okay? So does anyone have any questions?

625
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:02,463
Oh yes, I do. Okay, so you guys are based in Taiwan now, right?

626
00:40:02,463 --> 00:40:07,667
Yeah. So if we, as developers, if we're making,

627
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:19,555
say we're making a contract with you guys, a very simple and silly question is, will

628
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:20,355
you be...

629
00:40:21,938 --> 00:40:24,622
Mandarin contract or English contract?

630
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:25,563
We do both.

631
00:40:25,563 --> 00:40:30,870
So we, I will say this, because our company was based in China for so long, our contracts

632
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:34,194
are in simplified Chinese, not traditional Chinese.

633
00:40:34,194 --> 00:40:36,778
But that's something that we're looking into.

634
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:37,078
Yeah.

635
00:40:37,078 --> 00:40:37,138
We...

636
00:40:37,429 --> 00:40:42,672
What we generally do is we have a Chinese and an English version and they are both identical

637
00:40:42,672 --> 00:40:46,333
and they cannot be changed without linking the other, that's a point in the contract.

638
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:51,976
So we have to have both because, for example, at OtherIndie we also operate an Irish office

639
00:40:51,976 --> 00:40:55,918
which allows us to do a lot of good things with Steam that helps everybody out.

640
00:40:55,918 --> 00:41:04,762
So we have to have English and, but we always try to make sure that whatever language we're

641
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,283
dealing with is catered to.

642
00:41:07,393 --> 00:41:09,495
Right, okay, thanks.

643
00:41:09,495 --> 00:41:17,623
So the contract will be, say, legal stuff, like, let's say just legal shit.

644
00:41:17,623 --> 00:41:24,109
Is it, like, apply for, like, Taiwanese law or Irish law or Chinese, like, mainland China law?

645
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:29,875
Well, for now it's in China, and China, Hong Kong, and Ireland is what we have the contract set up for.

646
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:35,802
if you guys needed or really like we need this set up for Taiwanese law for the company purposes

647
00:41:35,802 --> 00:41:40,284
then we would do that as well like you know we would we would find a lawyer and we would make

648
00:41:40,284 --> 00:41:45,105
that happen and you should make that happen like if that's something that you need and you because

649
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:49,547
different countries are different like a lot of countries just obey US law because that's where

650
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:54,408
most of the money comes from anyway but if for some specific reason you guys need it to obey

651
00:41:54,408 --> 00:41:55,168
Taiwanese law

652
00:41:56,246 --> 00:42:04,968
And you do that. You tell them, no, I need this in Taiwanese, I need this vetted by a Taiwanese lawyer.

653
00:42:04,968 --> 00:42:09,630
You do that. You cover your ass.

654
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,710
Thank you.

655
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,470
No problem.

656
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:14,271
Any other questions?

657
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:15,171
Hello, I'm CJ.

658
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:15,512
Hi CJ.

659
00:42:15,512 --> 00:42:17,752
I have a question of curiosity.

660
00:42:17,752 --> 00:42:23,974
So, does the number of the developers in the development team affect the evaluation?

661
00:42:25,392 --> 00:42:37,637
It definitely does, because for example, if somebody turns around to me and says I have 20 developers and I need 10,000 US dollars, I go, that doesn't make sense.

662
00:42:37,637 --> 00:42:41,018
Like, 10,000 dollars doesn't pay 20 developers.

663
00:42:41,018 --> 00:42:43,579
So, a lot of times, it factors into the math.

664
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:45,280
Like, for the game, not so much.

665
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,402
Our most popular game was developed by a team of four people at the beginning.

666
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:55,164
It's now, they've now done well, so they've moved on and they've now done well.

667
00:42:55,545 --> 00:43:06,787
And one of our, I don't want to say least popular, because it's a very good game, but

668
00:43:06,787 --> 00:43:10,647
one of our not so well performing games had a team of 15 plus.

669
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:15,468
So actually in terms of how well a game does, the number of developers doesn't matter.

670
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:18,329
It's all about the actual game and it's all about the audience.

671
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,409
So it's just a matter of math?

672
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:22,690
Just a matter of math, figuring out the math.

673
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:38,825
about when a developer is approaching a publisher, we should look for what the publisher...

674
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:45,647
One of the numbers is how much the publisher needs to recoup.

675
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:50,648
Have you ever had a developer calculate that for you, in a sense?

676
00:43:50,648 --> 00:43:56,229
And how would you feel if they approach you and say,

677
00:43:56,229 --> 00:43:57,649
Hey, we sort of like...

678
00:43:58,077 --> 00:44:02,780
Yeah, of course, I mean so generally what we do is like we draft the first contract

679
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,662
because that's kind of the publisher's job.

680
00:44:05,662 --> 00:44:13,807
So we draft the first contract based on our knowledge and our research and then they will

681
00:44:13,807 --> 00:44:17,830
come back to us saying, okay, this is good, this is good, however this one we think we

682
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,192
need to talk about, this one... and that's totally normal.

683
00:44:20,192 --> 00:44:23,053
So I always advise everybody to...

684
00:44:23,654 --> 00:44:25,655
把資料放進去,把數據放進去

685
00:44:25,655 --> 00:44:27,036
因為如果我們有做錯,那我也想知道

686
00:44:27,036 --> 00:44:31,457
如果你們覺得有些東西太高或太低,我也想知道

687
00:44:31,457 --> 00:44:34,238
我無法保證我會同意,但至少我想知道謝謝

688
00:44:56,586 --> 00:44:59,987
不知道大家有沒有前面聽不懂的地方

689
00:44:59,987 --> 00:45:01,667
或是要再了解的地方

690
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:33,103
Once they are on the shelf, on the store, the selling will be like a big wave like tsunami

691
00:45:33,103 --> 00:45:35,584
and then drop down very quick, right?

692
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:35,644
Yes.

693
00:45:35,644 --> 00:45:44,347
Yeah, and how do you like for newly coming games, did you guys have like a standard selling

694
00:45:44,347 --> 00:45:48,889
period or like how long are you going to promote it?

695
00:45:49,218 --> 00:45:50,059
Something like that?

696
00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:53,942
It depends on the game and it depends on that initial success.

697
00:45:53,942 --> 00:45:58,465
You are correct. So we will always promote a game throughout the first year of its launch.

698
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:00,447
Like always, always, always.

699
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:05,531
So even games that don't do as well as we would like for that first year, they always are with us at PAX

700
00:46:05,531 --> 00:46:10,335
and they always are with us when we are doing international promotions.

701
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:13,197
But you are correct in saying if a game really does just hit that wall,

702
00:46:13,197 --> 00:46:18,542
then we do have to move on and we encourage the developers to do the same.

703
00:46:18,933 --> 00:46:25,281
Right, but what happened if say I'm a developer right and I was putting like

704
00:46:25,281 --> 00:46:32,451
my like three four year time in this game and and I I felt disappointed with the the selling and I was like

705
00:46:32,451 --> 00:46:36,036
Started starting bothering you guys. I hate it's three months and

706
00:46:36,398 --> 00:46:40,800
should we do something, are you guys going to do something for our game? Save my game!

707
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,981
So that's what we do. So we have had games that haven't done as well as we wanted and

708
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:50,382
what we do is we scale down and then we start talking about, ok, milestones. So in order

709
00:46:50,382 --> 00:46:56,023
to promote a game you need to have something to promote, right? So what are we going to

710
00:46:56,023 --> 00:46:59,904
do? So what can you give me that I can promote? And we do it like that. So we do updates,

711
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:03,665
we do DLC, we do whatever we can do that's manageable.

712
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:10,336
And generally as a rule we do see those returns start to go up or at least even out.

713
00:47:10,336 --> 00:47:18,681
One thing that we are good at is we are very good at community building because my anime friend here is really good at community building.

714
00:47:19,189 --> 00:47:24,571
And so what we generally have is we, on the launch of a game, we generally have a pretty

715
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:31,053
passionate fan base which ensures a certain level of sales at that first opening, but

716
00:47:31,053 --> 00:47:36,455
then those people will help you sell the game, they will tell their friends, they will evangelise

717
00:47:36,455 --> 00:47:37,295
for you.

718
00:47:37,295 --> 00:47:41,137
And that's really, really important and you know, our Discord channel is...

719
00:47:41,841 --> 00:47:49,268
is amazing. We have amazing people in there who are so passionate, not just about our games, but about gaming in general.

720
00:47:49,268 --> 00:47:58,417
And those places are so important. So that's one thing that you can always be doing is building that community.

721
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:03,221
So one game that we had that we launched was a JRPG and it's very, very big.

722
00:48:03,457 --> 00:48:08,299
It was a long time in development and the sales were not as high as we had hoped.

723
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:13,761
They were not so low that it killed everybody, but they were not as high as we'd hoped.

724
00:48:13,761 --> 00:48:18,844
So what we did is we got all of the feedback, we got all of the information from the users,

725
00:48:18,844 --> 00:48:25,047
and we've now started the process of updating the game to fix those problems.

726
00:48:25,047 --> 00:48:30,289
So initially it was like quite small issues, like things like people wanted an autosave.

727
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:31,750
Done. That was a quick easy fix.

728
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:38,173
People wanted the opening area to be a little bit less intense. Done. Easy.

729
00:48:38,173 --> 00:48:43,336
But one of the big problems that we had was that people really, really hated one of the characters.

730
00:48:43,336 --> 00:48:45,237
Like, they fucking hated her.

731
00:48:45,237 --> 00:48:54,041
Like, every negative review was like, I like the game, but fuck this character.

732
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:55,122
And so we ended up...

733
00:48:59,215 --> 00:49:03,837
So what we've done now is we've actually embarked on a mission where we've started to rewrite that character.

734
00:49:03,837 --> 00:49:06,418
And that's a really big task in a JRPG.

735
00:49:06,418 --> 00:49:08,619
Like, there's a fucking lot of words!

736
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:15,862
So we have to rewrite that character, but then also rewrite the things around that character so that it makes sense.

737
00:49:15,862 --> 00:49:20,584
And that's been really tricky, but we just announced that earlier this week.

738
00:49:20,584 --> 00:49:21,944
And our reviews are going...

739
00:49:21,944 --> 00:49:27,626
Just because a lot of negative attention that we got from the community...

740
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:31,774
We're then messaging all those people saying,

741
00:49:31,774 --> 00:49:36,059
hey, we listened to what you said, here's our update,

742
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:39,523
please let us know what you think, did we make it better?

743
00:49:39,523 --> 00:49:42,086
And then those negatives turn to positives,

744
00:49:42,086 --> 00:49:43,267
and as those positives go up,

745
00:49:43,267 --> 00:49:44,649
and with the Steam Summer Sale being on right now,

746
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:46,050
you know, shit gets easier.

747
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:52,805
So there is always a way to do it. It does depend on your publisher as well. It depends on you guys.

748
00:49:52,805 --> 00:50:02,611
Because one thing I do always say is that if you are a smaller indie game, you probably want to find a smaller indie publisher.

749
00:50:02,611 --> 00:50:13,659
Because going with a big boy means that if your game doesn't have that initial success, you just get pushed to the side and then move on with the next title.

750
00:50:13,659 --> 00:50:16,020
Whereas with us, because we don't have the capacity...

751
00:50:18,383 --> 00:50:20,705
have to make those games make money.

752
00:50:20,705 --> 00:50:27,211
Because if we have one game that loses a shitload of money,

753
00:50:27,211 --> 00:50:29,072
that really hurts us.

754
00:50:29,072 --> 00:50:33,616
Whereas if EA has a game that loses a shitload of money,

755
00:50:33,616 --> 00:50:34,657
they go, ha ha, Battlefront.

756
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:34,897
So, yeah.

757
00:50:34,897 --> 00:50:38,980
So can I follow up on that question actually?

758
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:40,962
You mentioned how...

759
00:50:41,963 --> 00:50:47,025
how many games you can do at once, like your capacity of publishing games and promoting games.

760
00:50:47,025 --> 00:50:48,565
So what's your capacity right now?

761
00:50:48,565 --> 00:50:56,507
So what we want to do right now is we want to sign maybe two or three more games for next year

762
00:50:56,507 --> 00:51:03,589
because by this year point we then start going to legacy stuff so we're no longer updating several of our games.

763
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:05,869
We continue to promote them during...

764
00:51:06,911 --> 00:51:14,656
sales, bundles, things like that, and get as much money as we can out for the developers,

765
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:19,900
but we're no longer actively updating those games. We've got two games that are about

766
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:27,405
to kind of hit that point now. So we're looking to replace those games. So yeah, I think we're

767
00:51:27,405 --> 00:51:32,468
probably never going to be working on any more than ten projects simultaneously, and

768
00:51:32,468 --> 00:51:35,690
active projects probably only around five or six.

769
00:51:36,482 --> 00:51:39,645
You know who's doing the business here, no?

770
00:51:39,645 --> 00:51:40,225
Sorry.

771
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:41,866
No, keep going, keep going.

772
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:45,229
Initially, how long is the term for the contract in another union?

773
00:51:45,229 --> 00:51:46,269
So we open at three years.

774
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,931
Three years is what we open at.

775
00:51:48,931 --> 00:51:58,158
On some we've gone longer, and on some we've gone shorter, depending on the game and depending on the requirements.

776
00:51:58,158 --> 00:52:02,081
But yeah, three years is our opening.

777
00:52:03,138 --> 00:52:14,184
And then it depends. Obviously, if you wish to continue us to promote the game after that time, then we'll do that.

778
00:52:14,184 --> 00:52:19,828
But we're very, very flexible. We haven't hit that point of any other games yet,

779
00:52:19,828 --> 00:52:25,791
because the only game that came close was continuing to update and now continuing to work with us.

780
00:52:25,791 --> 00:52:30,293
Man, you guys should have sat next to each other.

781
00:52:30,293 --> 00:52:32,995
Why don't you come to the front?

782
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:38,513
What's your opinion on game competitions and game exhibitions?

783
00:52:38,513 --> 00:52:51,480
Okay, it's complicated. So, if you are relying on a game exhibition to sell more copies of your game, and that is why you are doing it, then that is a bad idea.

784
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:58,403
Because from what we have gathered, going to game exhibitions does not actively sell games.

785
00:52:58,403 --> 00:52:59,424
But, there is no...

786
00:52:59,661 --> 00:53:02,842
nowhere else where you will meet fellow developers

787
00:53:02,842 --> 00:53:06,343
and where you'll get the level of feedback and where you'll get the level of networking

788
00:53:06,343 --> 00:53:11,145
done and engage in that camaraderie that's so important

789
00:53:11,145 --> 00:53:13,726
as you do at conventions. So I always

790
00:53:13,726 --> 00:53:18,827
advise developers, if they can, to do them. I mean, you guys have Taipei Game Show

791
00:53:18,827 --> 00:53:22,348
in Taipei, which is growing and is cool

792
00:53:22,348 --> 00:53:24,129
and I've been to and I like it.

793
00:53:24,709 --> 00:53:29,254
you should go to that. If you're in Taipei and you are not going to Taipei Game Show,

794
00:53:29,254 --> 00:53:33,900
you need to look in the mirror and ask yourself, why are you not going to Taipei Game Show?

795
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,902
Because it's there. You can throw a stone and hit it.

796
00:53:35,902 --> 00:53:41,308
And that's really important. When you have these things there for you, where international

797
00:53:41,308 --> 00:53:44,792
people are coming from around the world to show their stuff, to talk, to hang out.

798
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:46,674
And here's the other thing that I always say is...

799
00:53:49,715 --> 00:53:56,117
at these events. So my first year doing this job, I didn't actually showcase any of our

800
00:53:56,117 --> 00:54:01,518
games. What I did is I called up all of my friends and I said, hey, I need to go to these

801
00:54:01,518 --> 00:54:07,880
places and see if they're worth going to. I'll help you guys out. So I actually worked

802
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,342
on other people's boots, selling and promoting other games, and I figured out how it was

803
00:54:12,342 --> 00:54:16,543
working, who was doing what, and how that was happening. You know, I got a free hotel.

804
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:21,072
I had to pay for my own flights, but it wasn't that much.

805
00:54:21,072 --> 00:54:27,655
And there's a lot of people in the games industry that would be more than happy to help out

806
00:54:27,655 --> 00:54:30,296
people who want to go to these events and check them out.

807
00:54:30,296 --> 00:54:32,197
Because they are important.

808
00:54:32,197 --> 00:54:37,460
But probably, in my opinion, what's more important is going to the bar afterwards.

809
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,201
Or going to the coffee shop, or going to the restaurant.

810
00:54:40,201 --> 00:54:43,763
Because that's where you meet people, that's where you talk to people, that's where you

811
00:54:43,763 --> 00:54:45,204
share ideas, and that's where...

812
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,690
things start happening.

813
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:48,531
There was another thing.

814
00:54:48,531 --> 00:54:49,891
Game competitions, right?

815
00:54:49,891 --> 00:54:50,592
Yeah.

816
00:54:50,592 --> 00:54:53,713
Game competitions are cool,

817
00:54:53,713 --> 00:54:55,554
providing you're not spending money on them.

818
00:54:55,554 --> 00:54:58,955
Um, I, there's a lot of competitions now

819
00:54:58,955 --> 00:55:03,277
that are asking for like $100 to get into the competition

820
00:55:03,277 --> 00:55:04,638
or $200 even to get into a competition.

821
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:04,918
Fuck that.

822
00:55:04,918 --> 00:55:07,119
Like, if you have a publisher,

823
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:08,460
make your publisher pay for that shit.

824
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,980
That's what we do.

825
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:13,162
Um, but if you're doing it as like a solo developer, like.

826
00:55:13,651 --> 00:55:19,373
There's been an awful lot of people taking money and not doing their jobs with regards to that stuff.

827
00:55:19,373 --> 00:55:24,214
So I would be very, very, very careful about whenever you're paying.

828
00:55:24,214 --> 00:55:27,015
There's some that are okay, like for example, The Mix.

829
00:55:27,015 --> 00:55:32,937
I believe they're $25 a game or $50 a game, but then you buy into every competition for the whole year.

830
00:55:32,937 --> 00:55:36,918
So actually, they've got four competitions a year and you're only paying like $50.

831
00:55:36,918 --> 00:55:37,418
That's fine.

832
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:45,862
Indie Mega Booth, the entrance fee is also, it carries over, so I think it's a hundred dollars, but then it's for all of the Indie Mega Booths for that year.

833
00:55:45,862 --> 00:55:50,146
That's also fine. But there's some other ones that are crazy expensive, and I just, I don't see the point.

834
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:56,471
It doesn't sell games. All you need to do if you want to know this is look at, uh, Where the Water Tastes Like Wine.

835
00:55:56,471 --> 00:56:03,296
That game's amazing. It won every competition. And it came out, and nobody bought it.

836
00:56:03,296 --> 00:56:05,178
Sold like three thousand copies.

837
00:56:05,845 --> 00:56:15,208
我相信現在已經有改善了,但贏得比賽並不代表贏得賽事,你必須要注意到這一點,因為如果你去那邊期待它會做得好,因為它會傷害你。

838
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:15,788
謝謝,小鳳。

839
00:56:15,788 --> 00:56:15,808
沒問題。

840
00:56:35,784 --> 00:56:37,585
像剛剛提到有一些比賽

841
00:56:37,585 --> 00:56:40,366
其實他們是因為參賽的件數實在太多

842
00:56:40,366 --> 00:56:44,389
所以他們還是會收一定程度的手續費

843
00:56:44,389 --> 00:56:47,211
那手續費可能譬如說是50塊美金或100塊美金

844
00:56:47,211 --> 00:56:50,873
那我們基金會這邊其實是有挑其中幾個

845
00:56:50,873 --> 00:56:56,797
我們自己評價覺得比較值得信賴的獨立遊戲競賽

846
00:56:56,797 --> 00:56:59,639
然後我們也已經cover好幾年了

847
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:02,080
這些通常都是比較有前瞻性的

848
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,521
或是說比較有機會到

849
00:57:05,031 --> 00:57:08,493
那種跟歐美獨立遊戲接觸比較深入的

850
00:57:08,493 --> 00:57:11,035
譬如說像IGF相關的

851
00:57:11,035 --> 00:57:14,257
或是IndieK的這些競賽

852
00:57:14,257 --> 00:57:17,619
那你去那邊主要的目的其實並不是

853
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:19,340
就如果你真的入圍的話

854
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,521
你的目的主要並不是說

855
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,502
因為這個東西可以讓你多賺多少錢

856
00:57:22,502 --> 00:57:24,203
而是你如果入圍的話

857
00:57:24,203 --> 00:57:27,885
你可以算是打進一個跟你平常不一樣的圈子裡面

858
00:57:27,885 --> 00:57:31,487
因為他們那些平常有入圍有得獎的那些內掛的

859
00:57:31,487 --> 00:57:33,448
其實在歐美或是全球是有一個

860
00:57:34,178 --> 00:57:35,139
一個圈子在的

861
00:57:35,139 --> 00:57:37,520
那你能夠被這個圈子認可

862
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,180
然後你能夠被這個圈子

863
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:42,862
他們所就是呃

864
00:57:42,862 --> 00:57:44,223
接觸的受眾認可

865
00:57:44,223 --> 00:57:45,603
那其實那算是一種

866
00:57:45,603 --> 00:57:46,924
也算是一種品牌的保證

867
00:57:46,924 --> 00:57:48,364
那包括之前

868
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,485
像Steam

869
00:57:49,485 --> 00:57:51,005
他們在Greenlight還沒出來之前

870
00:57:51,005 --> 00:57:52,466
他們其實就是靠譬如說

871
00:57:52,466 --> 00:57:54,027
欸你如果indicate入圍

872
00:57:54,027 --> 00:57:55,147
他們可以直接讓你上架

873
00:57:55,147 --> 00:57:57,388
或是IGF入圍他們可以直接幫你上

874
00:57:57,388 --> 00:57:58,148
直接讓你上架

875
00:57:58,148 --> 00:57:59,209
其實是有一些

876
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:00,169
有一些認證效果在

877
00:58:00,169 --> 00:58:01,630
當然這些效果其實

878
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:03,290
最近幾年我是覺得是有下降

879
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,022
但是我覺得這個機會我們基金會這邊的贊助還是一直有保持

880
00:58:08,022 --> 00:58:10,163
那包括像

881
00:58:10,163 --> 00:58:12,925
之前我們也贊助過自主到Indie-K的

882
00:58:12,925 --> 00:58:16,027
然後像去年我們有贊助了

883
00:58:16,027 --> 00:58:20,569
台灣四個團隊去上海的Indie-Play

884
00:58:20,569 --> 00:58:20,729
就是

885
00:58:20,729 --> 00:58:21,430
只要他們有入圍

886
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:22,810
那我們這邊其實就會提供

887
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,012
就是相關的費用

888
00:58:25,012 --> 00:58:25,852
薪水補助這樣子

889
00:58:26,459 --> 00:58:29,140
如果你真的有投稿費用困難的話

890
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,221
其實我們也還是有辦法提供投稿費用的補助

891
00:58:31,221 --> 00:58:34,243
可能就是那種三千塊台幣、兩千塊台幣之類的

892
00:58:34,243 --> 00:58:36,664
這種補助我們也是有提供過

893
00:58:36,664 --> 00:58:37,724
相關的資料可以上

894
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:39,585
我們就是優生研究競技會的網站可以看

895
00:58:39,585 --> 00:58:40,266
就是有一個國際遊戲競賽的補助辦法

896
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,827
Does that make any sense to you?

897
00:58:42,827 --> 00:58:44,007
No, sorry.

898
00:58:44,007 --> 00:58:55,312
I was trying to follow up for the first 30 seconds and I just went, nah.

899
00:58:56,266 --> 00:59:07,131
Basically we do sponsor all of our scholarship to some of the indie competitions, like IGF and IndieGate.

900
00:59:07,131 --> 00:59:11,313
And we've been doing that for... this is like 7th year? 8th year?

901
00:59:11,313 --> 00:59:19,077
So every year there's a few teams that get recognized and get finalist or nominated by some competition and we'll just...

902
00:59:19,077 --> 00:59:22,018
You guys are good and we'll just send you.

903
00:59:22,018 --> 00:59:23,339
Yeah, that's good.

904
00:59:23,339 --> 00:59:25,460
Come to things like this, they help.

905
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:28,510
還有人有其他問題嗎?現在時間剩不多了

906
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:28,850
沒有問題

907
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:34,552
I like your T-shirt

908
00:59:34,552 --> 00:59:37,673
Thank you

909
00:59:37,673 --> 00:59:39,693
我英文不好我講中文

910
00:59:39,693 --> 00:59:40,873
可以 我們都可以幫忙翻譯

911
00:59:40,873 --> 00:59:43,214
好 那我再問一個很不好意思的問題

912
00:59:43,214 --> 00:59:48,235
我個人在做18禁的情色遊戲

913
00:59:48,235 --> 00:59:50,896
想問你對18禁的情色遊戲有什麼看法

914
00:59:52,395 --> 00:59:55,458
Do you do R-18 stuff? Rated-18 stuff?

915
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:55,778
Yeah!

916
00:59:55,778 --> 00:59:56,158
Like, I'm...

917
00:59:56,158 --> 01:00:00,042
Honestly, like, I...

918
01:00:00,042 --> 01:00:06,447
Personally, I have absolutely no problem doing anything.

919
01:00:06,447 --> 01:00:11,411
Like, I'm murdering, killing, sex, anything, I don't give a damn.

920
01:00:11,411 --> 01:00:15,054
What I need to do is be able to prove that people will buy it,

921
01:00:15,054 --> 01:00:16,755
and that people want to buy it.

922
01:00:16,755 --> 01:00:20,338
I have absolutely no problems with discussing any type of game.

923
01:00:20,879 --> 01:00:32,210
And I don't think that even if I can't help you out with something, if I think the project is cool, I can put you in touch with people who can help you out with something.

924
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:41,659
So you know, if you're working on something ultra-violent or ultra-sexy, fucking do it! You do you, man!

925
01:00:41,659 --> 01:00:45,182
Don't be afraid of being creative and making what you want to make.

926
01:00:45,182 --> 01:00:45,422
Thank you.

927
01:00:45,422 --> 01:00:45,843
No problem.

928
01:00:49,742 --> 01:00:51,825
因為我們休息時間差不多了

929
01:00:51,825 --> 01:00:55,830
那這個Session已經進行了快一個小時了

930
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:57,172
那我想最後給個熱烈掌聲
