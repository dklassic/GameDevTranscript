1
00:00:00,699 --> 00:00:05,024
我們這次邀請到 Imperial Games 42

2
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:10,770
Imperial 42 Games 的 Dylan 跟 Elsa

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,052
他們是一個跨國團隊

4
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:12,873
然後夫妻倆剛好在台灣

5
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:16,056
他們做的是一款類似像人狼的那種

6
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:17,658
需要用言語交談來推理的遊戲

7
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:28,423
So I'm Dylan, this is Elsa.

8
00:00:28,423 --> 00:00:30,784
We're with Imperium 42 Game Studio.

9
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:34,005
And we made Throne of Lies.

10
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:37,546
And so right now it's for PC, Mac, and Linux.

11
00:00:37,546 --> 00:00:40,567
And today I'm going to be telling you

12
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:44,168
about what I did right, what I did wrong,

13
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:46,909
and some general information that can help you

14
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:50,530
as indie developers.

15
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,031
So to start, I'm gonna show you what we started.

16
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:56,472
So when we first started, this is what it looked like.

17
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:58,167
It was pretty sad.

18
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:03,009
So this is when we were sort of experimenting a little bit.

19
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:06,871
This was very early stage here.

20
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:12,794
And then, now, this is about two years later, suddenly.

21
00:01:12,794 --> 00:01:22,738
This is our thirty-second trailer, when we launched.

22
00:01:22,738 --> 00:01:23,778
So we're, uh...

23
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:26,957
We're a 3D social production game.

24
00:01:26,957 --> 00:01:32,021
And this means that there are good guys and bad guys,

25
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:36,164
and the good guys have to figure out who the bad guys are.

26
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:38,606
And in this game, it's online.

27
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:39,506
There's 16 players.

28
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:42,849
And you have some unique features

29
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:44,210
like drawing death notes.

30
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,011
It's all online.

31
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:48,193
It's done by a team of, we have a team of eight,

32
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:50,534
and the actual programmers are two.

33
00:01:50,534 --> 00:01:51,895
I'm one of the programmers,

34
00:01:51,895 --> 00:01:53,777
and the other programmer is in the United States.

35
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,190
And to get started, let's go.

36
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:02,253
So I told you a little bit about who I am generally.

37
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:03,353
I'm American.

38
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:04,294
I'm half British.

39
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:07,316
I've been living here with my wife, Elsa,

40
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:10,477
for about three years now.

41
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:15,840
I know that in Taiwan, cyber cafes are everywhere,

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,881
sort of like as often as you see Starbucks.

43
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:20,823
But in America, that's a very small thing.

44
00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:25,665
I actually ran the first gaming cafe in South Carolina.

45
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:30,413
And so there I programmed some of our apps,

46
00:02:30,413 --> 00:02:33,094
and then eventually I worked for the company

47
00:02:33,094 --> 00:02:35,775
that ran our gaming cafe software.

48
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:37,655
And that was called Smart Launch at the time.

49
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:42,377
After that I went to Hawaii, where I met Elsa.

50
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:43,877
I went there for educational purposes.

51
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:47,618
And eventually I came to Taiwan.

52
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:51,399
And in between I worked all kinds of developer jobs.

53
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:55,060
I've done websites, back end, front end, full stack.

54
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:57,967
You know, just a bunch of little things.

55
00:02:57,967 --> 00:03:01,068
Nothing really significant that I could really tell you.

56
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:08,230
Eventually, I didn't like my job, which is pretty much everyone's story, I'm sure.

57
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,031
And so I started programming a game on the side.

58
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,331
And that's when we launched Imperium 42.

59
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:19,673
So, Throne of Lies is our first game.

60
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:24,899
I told you a bit about it, you saw the trailer. It's made with Unity.

61
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:29,702
Right now it's Windows, Mac, Linux, maybe VR in the future, who knows.

62
00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:35,005
Right now we have about 42,000 downloads in four months, so that's pretty good.

63
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:38,047
We only launched in October.

64
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:42,529
It's very similar to Town of Salem, if you've played that, or this game,

65
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:46,152
which is a popular mobile game that you guys may be familiar with.

66
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,328
So to start, I knew no Unity.

67
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:54,889
I knew nothing.

68
00:03:54,889 --> 00:04:02,170
But I made some text adventure games with BB.net a while back.

69
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,751
And I like gaming, obviously.

70
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:06,832
But I didn't know where to start.

71
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:08,192
It's sort of overwhelming.

72
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:10,312
So eventually, I went to a Unity class.

73
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:14,133
And even though my Chinese is terrible,

74
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:18,734
and I was still able to absorb everything in the class.

75
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:19,575
Unity is in English.

76
00:04:21,037 --> 00:04:24,820
And so this really helped me.

77
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,262
In cram school, opposed to just a regular education,

78
00:04:28,262 --> 00:04:30,763
they really push through really fast.

79
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:32,364
So suddenly, in just a few months,

80
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:35,987
I made just a little online zombie shooter.

81
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:38,268
And from there, I felt really confident.

82
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:41,090
So I started making a game on the side.

83
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,432
I was still working full time as a developer, remotely.

84
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:48,855
So what ended up happening was I realized that.

85
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:56,987
I needed help, I couldn't do it by myself if I wanted this to be a real game, and I did it.

86
00:04:56,987 --> 00:04:59,728
I'll talk more about finding people later,

87
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:01,208
but for now, we also did a...

88
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:04,550
I've been through a Kickstarter.

89
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,551
We successfully funded $21,000, we asked for $20,000.

90
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:11,953
I'll also be talking more about Kickstarter tips later on if you're interested in something like that.

91
00:05:11,953 --> 00:05:13,614
I started off as just

92
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:18,736
by myself, and then eventually, I told you I needed help, I found a partner.

93
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:19,196
And...

94
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,031
He's a developer in the United States.

95
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:25,652
He is the only other programmer.

96
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:28,672
And once you have two, it starts getting official.

97
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:29,392
You start feeling it.

98
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:32,933
And then eventually, management.

99
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,414
And management is something that a lot of people don't

100
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:37,434
expect, but it sort of comes your way.

101
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:39,375
Suddenly, I'm developing less.

102
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,195
I want to develop more, but I have to manage.

103
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:44,916
So you have to think about legal, and hiring, and HR,

104
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:48,457
which I passed on to her, luckily.

105
00:05:48,457 --> 00:05:49,537
Yeah, so if you have.

106
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:52,845
If you have a partner, then ask for a wife, a spouse,

107
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:54,146
or something that really helps too,

108
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,667
if it lays off some of the burden.

109
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:59,349
I used to do C Sharp.

110
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:01,390
I used to do VB.net when I started.

111
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,311
Now it's sort of a dead language.

112
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:04,291
No one uses that.

113
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,033
That's why we got taught in school.

114
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,113
VB.net, C Cool.

115
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:15,808
So I threw all that aside. Now I'm doing C-sharp JavaScript with Node mostly, like vanilla JavaScript.

116
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:23,353
No SQL. No SQL is the future. No one really uses SQL anymore, unless it's really an old database no one wants to migrate to.

117
00:06:23,353 --> 00:06:29,177
I do a lot with APIs in DevOps. DevOps is sort of new to me, but APIs.

118
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:33,461
You guys, don't be afraid of APIs. They're your friends.

119
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:38,444
So like, you have Twitch and Discord and all these APIs.

120
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:44,638
to help you. You don't have to reinvent the wheel. So search for open source stuff first

121
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:57,604
as a template, or API stuff for doing anything you want. They usually have really good documentation.

122
00:06:57,604 --> 00:07:04,146
So I'm going to teach you how to run a worldwide studio. What you do is, it's overwhelming,

123
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:07,308
so you start with one, and then you find more.

124
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:10,447
And so where do you find more?

125
00:07:10,447 --> 00:07:13,147
I'm going to talk about that really soon.

126
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,508
But what you do want to do is when you hire people, you want

127
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:16,888
to give them the rules up front.

128
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:19,709
This is something you guys can definitely learn

129
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:20,689
from my mistakes.

130
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:24,089
So you want to have a contract at the very beginning.

131
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:25,450
You can Google free templates.

132
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,890
You don't have to hire a lawyer or spend any money.

133
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,831
Just Google it and edit it just a little bit.

134
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:33,631
You want to have the expectations up front.

135
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,112
You want to tell them they need to work x hours per week.

136
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:41,858
And they need to deliver in this type of way.

137
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:43,419
They need to communicate.

138
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:48,661
They must check in once every two days or three days.

139
00:07:48,661 --> 00:07:50,182
You need to tell them what's up.

140
00:07:50,182 --> 00:07:51,803
And this is where management comes in.

141
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:54,064
You really need to be strict on this, especially

142
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:56,445
at the beginning, because that's what sets the template.

143
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:57,585
You don't want to be stepped on.

144
00:07:57,585 --> 00:07:59,506
You need to give them deadlines.

145
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:01,087
At the beginning, you're not going

146
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:03,528
to know what the deadlines are.

147
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:05,849
You're going to say, oh, I have no idea how long this takes

148
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:06,189
to make.

149
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,862
But what you're going to do is you're going to make a deadline anyway.

150
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:09,402
You're going to guess.

151
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:14,086
So you're going to say, three days, two weeks, it doesn't matter.

152
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:16,848
Eventually, you'll start to learn how long things should take.

153
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:19,450
And if they need to extend it, they'll tell you.

154
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,753
This is also a good way to see if you can trust your employees.

155
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,395
Because if you're working remotely like I am,

156
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:31,419
then you've never met these people before.

157
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:33,680
And that's where it comes to trials.

158
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:37,329
Trials, what you can do is when you hire someone new,

159
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:40,470
especially remotely, give them a 30 day trial.

160
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,890
When you have 30 days, you can make sure

161
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,491
that they perform exactly the way you want them to perform.

162
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:51,152
And if something goes wrong, you could say, sorry guys,

163
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:52,852
that's the end of the trial.

164
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:53,912
This was a trial run.

165
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:57,373
It also gives you sort of an excuse

166
00:08:57,373 --> 00:08:59,173
to be sort of hard on them.

167
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:00,933
Because the beginning is everything.

168
00:09:02,495 --> 00:09:05,536
And that's how you can tell if you trust them or not.

169
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:07,517
Communication is the most important,

170
00:09:07,517 --> 00:09:08,938
especially for remote teams.

171
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:11,439
But even if you're in person, it's remote.

172
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:13,419
Communication is top key.

173
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,181
So Discord is what we use as the number one.

174
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,942
So Discord has really changed our development cycle

175
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:24,723
in the form of, we have one public one

176
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:25,944
and one private one.

177
00:09:25,944 --> 00:09:30,666
So the private one is internal for the company.

178
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,626
So we have.

179
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:38,179
a news section, we have a high level to do, we have a section for PR, marketing, legal,

180
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:44,343
development, and you can code bots for that too, I'll talk about that later.

181
00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:47,045
You can also use Trello.

182
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:52,629
If you guys have not used Trello before, it's sort of a scrum, agile type board.

183
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:55,651
It pretty much contains lists.

184
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:58,713
Actually I think I have it pulled up here, I can just show you what it looks like.

185
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:02,919
Where's my mouse?

186
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,299
There we go.

187
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:08,961
So you can organize it in different sections.

188
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:11,681
You can see a little bit of secrets that we're doing.

189
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:15,522
So we have a big backlog dump of things.

190
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:17,343
This should be tons of stuff.

191
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:20,303
Any time you think of it, just write it down.

192
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:22,864
Move it to things coming soon, even sooner.

193
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:25,685
And then you can assign it to whoever

194
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:27,845
with different priority levels and then drag it to done.

195
00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:29,085
It's pretty satisfying to see done.

196
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:38,649
So trust is a big deal and that's why trials are really important.

197
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:40,870
You want to keep your promises.

198
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:47,435
And if you can't keep a promise, that's the point of the communication.

199
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:52,659
So if you feel like you're starting to become sick, give a warning to the team.

200
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:57,142
If you're coming up on a deadline and you don't think it's realistic, tell them.

201
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:59,384
Everyone can be very...

202
00:11:00,407 --> 00:11:05,089
Very forgiving. As long as you communicate, then everything is under control.

203
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:13,512
It doesn't matter so much if you're late, it just matters that if you're late and nobody knows, that's when people get upset.

204
00:11:13,512 --> 00:11:20,955
So, that said, you should work as a team and be understanding of each other, because eventually you'll have things that come up too.

205
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:26,477
And as long as they're not making excuses every single week, then I think it's okay.

206
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:30,038
You can find the humor in cross-culture issues.

207
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:38,224
So, we have an artist in India, and sometimes we have the communication barrier.

208
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:43,106
And so, sometimes I'll explain what I want to see in an art illustration.

209
00:11:43,106 --> 00:11:45,988
And sometimes it doesn't come the way I want it.

210
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:51,171
So, what I end up doing is, instead of telling him in English what I want,

211
00:11:51,171 --> 00:11:54,192
I mean, I'll tell him in English for the basics,

212
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:57,434
but I'll launch up MS Paint, and I'll doodle something,

213
00:11:57,434 --> 00:12:00,055
and show him a picture of my paint.

214
00:12:00,516 --> 00:12:02,476
So, and it ends up being really funny.

215
00:12:02,476 --> 00:12:03,877
I actually save it.

216
00:12:03,877 --> 00:12:06,737
Sometimes, you know when you see those memes with a horse,

217
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:08,217
where he says, how to draw a horse,

218
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:09,978
and it shows just some basic drawing,

219
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:12,318
and then a full, like, beautiful horse?

220
00:12:12,318 --> 00:12:13,658
Yeah, something like that.

221
00:12:13,658 --> 00:12:14,958
It gets pretty funny.

222
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,579
But yeah, because it can be frustrating too, you know?

223
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:20,779
So, you gotta find the humor in it,

224
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:23,660
because that's the way to go.

225
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,901
And when you're talking about teammates and management,

226
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:29,421
you need to learn to move on or adapt.

227
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:32,234
At first, try to adapt, and then move on.

228
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:35,737
So it could be said about gameplay elements.

229
00:12:35,737 --> 00:12:39,580
Let's say you really want gameplay elements to work.

230
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,042
Like for example, you can see in our trailer,

231
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,823
they can draw death notes.

232
00:12:43,823 --> 00:12:45,385
They can draw on that.

233
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:47,526
And so at first, we couldn't figure out

234
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:52,611
how to send it over the multiplayer network

235
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:55,253
so that everyone can see the same image.

236
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:58,075
And then at first, we were going to abandon it.

237
00:12:58,075 --> 00:12:58,415
But then we just.

238
00:12:58,975 --> 00:13:01,637
We knew that it was a lot of code to swap methods.

239
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:05,339
And so we did that, and we adapted, and it worked.

240
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,821
But some things don't work, and sometimes you just

241
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,183
have to move on and accept that.

242
00:13:11,183 --> 00:13:14,005
And I said earlier, the same thing can apply to staff.

243
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:15,285
So let's say you hire someone.

244
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:17,827
In our case, PR guys, we find, are the hardest

245
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:18,908
to hire that are real.

246
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:23,550
And so sometimes you'll hire someone,

247
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,313
and their expectations don't meet your requirements.

248
00:13:28,178 --> 00:13:31,540
and what you do is you can try to adapt, try to, you know,

249
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,402
what we do is we have a software we use called Time Doctor,

250
00:13:34,402 --> 00:13:37,303
which is really useful for remote work.

251
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:40,144
It's like $10 a month,

252
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:43,206
and you can track their time and stuff.

253
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:44,406
You can, they'll take screenshots.

254
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,547
It's a little bit intrusive,

255
00:13:46,547 --> 00:13:48,709
but usually we use it for disciplinary action.

256
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:55,213
Anyway, if that doesn't work, you have to move on.

257
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:58,054
You have to get rid of them, respectfully, of course,

258
00:13:58,054 --> 00:13:59,254
and then try to find someone new.

259
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:02,095
For example, our PR guy, we had to get rid of him.

260
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:02,935
We got someone new.

261
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:03,675
And he was amazing.

262
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:05,056
He's been doing great.

263
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:06,677
Our engagement went up.

264
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:10,458
All this stuff, if we would have done this a long time ago,

265
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:14,459
then there wouldn't be any stress.

266
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:15,079
So yeah.

267
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:17,920
I mentioned earlier about Trello.

268
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,901
Scrum and Agile tactics are important,

269
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,522
because you really need to keep track.

270
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,390
of what everyone is doing.

271
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,911
It's also good for morale to see priority levels

272
00:14:26,911 --> 00:14:28,811
and who is working on what.

273
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:33,612
So when you see that everyone else is working together,

274
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:36,832
it really raises morale for the entire team.

275
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:40,973
And then it also means you don't have to really ask questions

276
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:42,973
what people are doing, like you're poking them.

277
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:46,474
Sometimes some people don't like that.

278
00:14:46,474 --> 00:14:48,194
Of course, you can ask what they're doing,

279
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:50,375
but you don't have to, which is sort of nice.

280
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,104
So all the developers here, the software developers,

281
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:58,667
the programmers, you probably know about Git.

282
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,688
But you may not know about GitLab.

283
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:02,629
Most people use GitHub.

284
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:05,251
That's sort of the flagship.

285
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:08,273
But GitLab has been an amazing experience.

286
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:13,256
You get 10 gigabytes for free, unlimited private repos,

287
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:16,598
and you can host your own GitLab on your VPS

288
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:19,440
if you use AWS, DigitalOcean, Google.

289
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,422
And so.

290
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:26,232
They also have support for continuous integration,

291
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:27,573
and that's also free.

292
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:31,356
This means that they have support for, if you push

293
00:15:31,356 --> 00:15:34,458
and you have a special keyword, you

294
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:39,022
can make it so that it will automatically compile for you

295
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,763
and push to Steam or something.

296
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:44,166
So you have automatic building and automatic uploading,

297
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:44,967
which is super nice.

298
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:47,068
That's something that we haven't done yet,

299
00:15:47,068 --> 00:15:48,870
but we really, really want to.

300
00:15:49,352 --> 00:15:50,973
And so you've got to look at the future.

301
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:55,916
So if you want something like that, use GitLab instead of GitHub.

302
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,078
Reddit has been a big part of our life.

303
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:01,139
We like reddit.com slash r slash gamedev.

304
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:05,282
And here you can find so much for free.

305
00:16:05,282 --> 00:16:07,343
I'm talking about music.

306
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:17,790
Any time someone goes to GDC, a group of open source composers

307
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,450
we'll put together a bunch of royalty-free music.

308
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,871
And when I say a bunch, I mean like 500 gigabytes

309
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:29,392
worth of free music and sounds, sound effects, everything,

310
00:16:29,392 --> 00:16:30,712
and art.

311
00:16:30,712 --> 00:16:32,913
So you can get so many things there.

312
00:16:32,913 --> 00:16:35,633
And what you want to do is, especially when you're starting,

313
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:36,754
you can just use placeholders.

314
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:40,635
I mean, you don't have to have the final product

315
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:43,475
at the beginning, especially since at the beginning,

316
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:45,996
you just want to prototype and show off the product

317
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:46,716
to get more.

318
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:53,374
teammates and maybe investors or something.

319
00:16:53,374 --> 00:16:53,815
So for

320
00:16:53,815 --> 00:17:01,117
when you're hiring staff, there's also a game dev branch called game dev classifieds.

321
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:04,619
That's where I actually found half of my team.

322
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,800
So I mean

323
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:13,842
just going from this to this reddit place and hiring someone just really, you know, the game wouldn't exist without it.

324
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:15,543
We had a zero budget.

325
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,335
when we started Throne of Lies.

326
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,276
Zero.

327
00:17:19,276 --> 00:17:21,578
So what we did was

328
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:23,379
we did profit sharing.

329
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:26,561
So we'll say if you work

330
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:27,802
every three hours per week

331
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:29,323
you work on Throne of Lies,

332
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:31,785
you get 1% of the company

333
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:32,025
profits.

334
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:34,647
So this encourages people.

335
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:36,889
But it doesn't encourage everyone.

336
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,450
It's not for everyone.

337
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,291
If you're on, for example,

338
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,453
GameDevClassifieds,

339
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:44,514
you're already expecting...

340
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,364
Profit sharing.

341
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:50,006
So you can launch a game like Throne of Lies

342
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:53,088
and not pay a penny until you actually

343
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:54,089
start making some money.

344
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:57,511
So especially if you have a remote team.

345
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:58,691
I work at home.

346
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:01,853
I don't have an office fee to pay.

347
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:04,955
And the remote staff, profit share,

348
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:07,176
it really helps if your budget is not huge.

349
00:18:07,176 --> 00:18:14,040
And that said, you should still have some savings

350
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,720
before you start.

351
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:19,177
because yeah, you will find unexpected things.

352
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:24,218
And the more money you have saved, the more secure you'll feel.

353
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:27,358
And if you have a spouse, the more secure they'll feel too.

354
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:31,979
You know, because if you suddenly say you're quitting your full-time job to

355
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:36,320
make a video game, you may get some weird looks.

356
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,721
But yeah, so before I quit, I made sure that I had savings.

357
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:45,481
we had staff. I made sure that we had a small scope.

358
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:55,186
And so, when I say small scope, I mean, I wouldn't recommend going out and making your

359
00:18:55,186 --> 00:19:03,050
first video game an MMO. That's huge. And when you're hiring people, people aren't

360
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:08,593
likely to follow you because they can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. You need

361
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:10,314
something where you can see from A to B.

362
00:19:11,112 --> 00:19:14,975
In our case, Throne of Lies, we know that it's a tabletop game.

363
00:19:14,975 --> 00:19:16,936
It's just one room.

364
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:18,537
And you can have other rooms, but it's

365
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:21,880
mostly focused on one room.

366
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,003
And I can list everything about the game on a Google Doc.

367
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:28,244
If you can't do that, your scope is too high.

368
00:19:28,244 --> 00:19:32,007
So be sure to just list the high-level architecture, which

369
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:32,447
I'll list soon.

370
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:38,551
And so this is sort of fluff talk, but if you're

371
00:19:39,217 --> 00:19:41,278
If you're stuck, just keep researching.

372
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:42,358
Don't give up.

373
00:19:42,358 --> 00:19:44,740
Google has all the answers to everything.

374
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,402
And you may be stumped for, maybe you just put a comma in

375
00:19:48,402 --> 00:19:50,563
the wrong place or something.

376
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:51,564
It's the same thing.

377
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:55,066
All programmers, especially, can speak for this.

378
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:57,587
You usually find the answer by realizing you

379
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:02,450
did something stupid.

380
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,533
So we found that DigitalOcean has been really useful for

381
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:08,633
our experience.

382
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:11,632
especially for an online game.

383
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:14,853
But even if you have an offline game, it can be very useful.

384
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:19,354
So if you have a VPS, DigitalOcean is cheaper

385
00:20:19,354 --> 00:20:24,836
and gives you more stuff, and is more simple than AWS and Google.

386
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:27,197
And I highly recommend it.

387
00:20:27,197 --> 00:20:29,858
In our case, we started off with a discourse forum.

388
00:20:29,858 --> 00:20:33,419
Because whether you have an online or offline game,

389
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,140
you want people talking about your game.

390
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,521
You want people discussing it.

391
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:41,740
And so Discourse is a Ruby-based forum.

392
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,060
It's very live and active.

393
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,462
And it's free, which is most important.

394
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:48,543
I pay $20 a month for my DigitalOcean

395
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:51,624
and have this Discourse.

396
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:55,765
And it's like a forum, but it's all live.

397
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:58,787
So you can see people typing a response.

398
00:20:58,787 --> 00:21:00,927
You can paste images directly in.

399
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,468
You don't have to refresh to see conversation flowing.

400
00:21:03,468 --> 00:21:04,529
Twitter uses it.

401
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,989
EVE Online uses it.

402
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:06,850
It's good stuff.

403
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:12,669
So I want to talk about back end as a service, BaaS.

404
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:18,311
So most people think this is only useful for online games.

405
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:19,932
I'm going to say it's not.

406
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:22,693
I'm going to say it's useful for both.

407
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:24,854
Because this is cloud storage.

408
00:21:24,854 --> 00:21:29,396
So what you can do is you can store stats in the cloud.

409
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:31,837
You can store authentication information.

410
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:35,398
You can store things that people may use.

411
00:21:35,398 --> 00:21:39,040
So in our example, people will log in through Steam.

412
00:21:39,497 --> 00:21:44,622
And when they log in through Steam, it goes to GameSparks.

413
00:21:44,622 --> 00:21:47,686
And from there, they have our internal ID.

414
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:49,247
And from there, we can link it to anything.

415
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:52,190
We can say log in with Twitch or Facebook or anything.

416
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,553
And that means we can link it to other things

417
00:21:54,553 --> 00:21:56,735
outside of the game.

418
00:21:56,735 --> 00:22:00,138
So for this, you can consider meta stuff.

419
00:22:00,138 --> 00:22:02,020
So for example, we can have our website.

420
00:22:02,593 --> 00:22:04,173
pull stats from the game.

421
00:22:04,173 --> 00:22:06,234
We can say, who has the most points?

422
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:07,515
Who has the most kills?

423
00:22:07,515 --> 00:22:11,096
Who has the highest level of number of achievements?

424
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,798
And these are things you can find in offline games, too.

425
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,619
And for online games, they also have server-side support.

426
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:21,461
Or if you're a single-player game, you want some DRM,

427
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:23,741
you don't want your game to end up on Pirate Bay,

428
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:27,383
then this is something that you can

429
00:22:27,383 --> 00:22:28,463
choose for server-side stuff.

430
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,930
So in our case, we can use it to make sure people don't cheat.

431
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,550
We can make sure that for multiplayer games,

432
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:41,051
it's not OK for people to cheat because it ruins other people's experience.

433
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:46,933
For single-player games, you might not care.

434
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,373
You guys should market early.

435
00:22:48,373 --> 00:22:51,594
And if you've been to developer conferences,

436
00:22:51,594 --> 00:22:55,915
this is probably something you hear in every single one.

437
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:56,855
It's very true.

438
00:22:56,855 --> 00:22:59,435
There are ways to do it very efficiently.

439
00:22:59,873 --> 00:23:02,754
I know you guys want to just jump into the game, but this is sort of a requirement.

440
00:23:02,754 --> 00:23:08,036
Because you don't want to have this awesome game and nobody knows about it.

441
00:23:08,036 --> 00:23:14,559
So, what you can do is you can make a single website and have just one hero banner.

442
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,401
You can hire someone on Fiverr.com, which I mention in a little bit.

443
00:23:19,401 --> 00:23:24,884
Fiverr.com, you spend $5, $10, and you can get some really awesome stuff.

444
00:23:24,884 --> 00:23:28,325
Some of it's sort of, you know, template-y. It's like a template, but...

445
00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:40,049
They're all very nice and some of them are very legit. You can get voiceovers. Actually, I have it pulled up

446
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:46,252
For like five bucks you can get logo design you can get like a single page page website voiceover

447
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:51,034
We have our original Kickstarter trailer had a two-minute voiceover

448
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:56,436
I paid $20 for it and the guy sounded amazing the guy sounded like some celebrity. Oh, it was great

449
00:23:57,438 --> 00:23:59,679
You think that voiceovers are really expensive?

450
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,239
They're not.

451
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:00,739
Go to Fiverr.com.

452
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:05,201
This is an awesome site for some things you've got to beware.

453
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:08,522
Some of the services are just terrible.

454
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:10,863
But half of them are amazing, and they'll

455
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:13,584
save you tons of money.

456
00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:13,784
Yeah.

457
00:24:13,784 --> 00:24:17,726
So let me go back to my slide here.

458
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:25,427
So when you market earlier, you have your single page website, you have all your social

459
00:24:25,427 --> 00:24:32,831
media set up like Twitter and Instagram. Instagram's getting really popular lately, we realized.

460
00:24:32,831 --> 00:24:38,894
And have it all linked to your website. You have a sign-up form with just only asking

461
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:47,599
for first name and email, nothing else. Now, 100% ask for first name because as a new company,

462
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,580
your email is going to be sent to spam.

463
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,603
And they have huge filters.

464
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:55,564
If Google doesn't recognize you, or Yahoo,

465
00:24:55,564 --> 00:25:01,447
whatever you use, you'll be sent the spam 50% of the time.

466
00:25:01,447 --> 00:25:05,049
So when you say their first name, like, hi, first name,

467
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:08,490
hi, Dylan, it goes through the filters.

468
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,732
Google thinks, hey, you know this person, so we're going to

469
00:25:11,732 --> 00:25:13,293
go through, even if you're new.

470
00:25:13,293 --> 00:25:15,033
So this is something you want to do.

471
00:25:15,434 --> 00:25:21,338
Also, email lists have value to you and also for future games.

472
00:25:21,338 --> 00:25:25,380
You can say, hey, you played our first game.

473
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:34,946
Check out our second game.

474
00:25:34,946 --> 00:25:37,888
You can think it for the future.

475
00:25:37,888 --> 00:25:44,672
OK, so we're at high level architecture.

476
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:48,621
I mentioned earlier about the game.

477
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:51,304
You should be able to structure it in a Google document

478
00:25:51,304 --> 00:25:52,064
properly.

479
00:25:52,064 --> 00:25:55,847
But the same should be done with your company.

480
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:58,850
So with that, you can just do that with a press kit.

481
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,073
And so a lot of times, if you Google for press kit templates,

482
00:26:02,073 --> 00:26:05,035
you'll see press kit with parentheses.

483
00:26:05,035 --> 00:26:05,676
That's old.

484
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:06,656
Don't use that.

485
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:09,819
That one uses PHP, and it's sort of dated.

486
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:13,040
You can use differently.

487
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,122
This differently is sort of a futuristic one.

488
00:26:16,122 --> 00:26:17,022
You can find it.

489
00:26:17,022 --> 00:26:18,363
It's open source on GitLab.

490
00:26:18,363 --> 00:26:21,444
For example, our press kit looks like this.

491
00:26:21,444 --> 00:26:24,846
It looks just like the old press kit with the parentheses.

492
00:26:24,846 --> 00:26:26,046
I think they call it doPressKit.

493
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:31,048
And so it's structured just very simply.

494
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,409
It's really easy.

495
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:33,730
It's templated.

496
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,411
All you need to do is replace their text with your own.

497
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,119
And while you're doing this, something

498
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:47,001
that really helps get yourself exposed to Twitch and YouTube

499
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:48,862
is offer cutouts.

500
00:26:48,862 --> 00:26:49,662
Check this out.

501
00:26:49,662 --> 00:26:53,164
So we have art cutouts, and we send these

502
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:53,904
to our content creators.

503
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:57,326
And this is useful for even bloggers, too.

504
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:59,547
Anyone that makes any content for your game,

505
00:26:59,547 --> 00:27:02,568
they have high quality assets.

506
00:27:02,568 --> 00:27:04,509
So if I click this, it's going to be

507
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:06,970
a giant, high resolution image, which is probably

508
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,930
going to take forever to load.

509
00:27:08,405 --> 00:27:09,125
And so it's huge.

510
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:11,127
You can't see it, but it's transparent.

511
00:27:11,127 --> 00:27:14,290
So they can use it on whatever article, or if they're

512
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,391
making, you know, YouTube, they have the thumbnails.

513
00:27:16,391 --> 00:27:19,514
They can make it effortlessly, over and over.

514
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:27,320
And that encourages them to play your game.

515
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,663
So a lot of people need support for their game.

516
00:27:30,663 --> 00:27:34,266
And for that, you can use Freshdesk.

517
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:35,887
Freshdesk is a.

518
00:27:36,808 --> 00:27:39,931
support desk service, and it's free.

519
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:44,314
And what's special about them is that you can have a support email,

520
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:46,456
like support at imperium42.com,

521
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:51,000
and the email will turn into a ticket automatically.

522
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,584
So that's really easy, so you can get your whole team to collaborate with each other.

523
00:27:56,584 --> 00:27:59,786
And you can have, there's also private notes and automated things,

524
00:27:59,786 --> 00:28:03,369
like if you have a scammer emailing you saying,

525
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:05,531
please give me 20 keys, then you can...

526
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:10,063
you can have an automated response based on certain keywords and stuff.

527
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,924
So there's always communication going with tickets.

528
00:28:13,924 --> 00:28:16,946
So everyone knows what's happening at the same time.

529
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:19,246
So let's say you're busy, you say,

530
00:28:19,246 --> 00:28:21,327
Elsa, please look at this ticket.

531
00:28:21,327 --> 00:28:24,549
Then she'll go and she'll already know what's going on.

532
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:31,251
There's no information ever lost between the agents looking at the support tickets.

533
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,012
Buffer is amazing.

534
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:40,930
will queue up your post for social media and send it to all the social media platforms

535
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,571
at the same time.

536
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:45,273
So let's say you have, it's a pain, right?

537
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:51,918
You're doing Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, I think they have others too even, like Pinterest,

538
00:28:51,918 --> 00:28:54,539
all the other little ones no one cares that much about.

539
00:28:54,539 --> 00:29:00,924
But you can have them, and you queue up your post and it'll send it at the times that Buffer

540
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:02,265
thinks is the perfect time.

541
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,931
for you to send them. It'll automatically space it out for you.

542
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:12,597
So let's say, in our case, the best time to send it out is 2am because we target America.

543
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:17,121
And so, if we go like, 2am, I'm not going to stay up until 2am and post it.

544
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:19,983
But, I can queue it up to buffer, and I can queue it up many times.

545
00:29:19,983 --> 00:29:22,525
I can queue up maybe 10 posts at a time.

546
00:29:22,525 --> 00:29:27,829
So I queue up 10 at a time, and it'll send it out to Twitter, Instagram, Facebook,

547
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:29,450
all at 2am automatically.

548
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:31,190
So this is good stuff.

549
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:37,514
And if you add multiple, it will automatically space it out.

550
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:40,496
Buffer.com. It's free, too.

551
00:29:40,496 --> 00:29:43,858
I'm not going to talk much about ads, but if you do do ads,

552
00:29:43,858 --> 00:29:50,622
in our experience, the best thing to look out for is don't do pay-per-view.

553
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,864
That's just... that's meant for companies like Coke, Coca-Cola,

554
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:55,926
that want brand recognition.

555
00:29:55,926 --> 00:29:57,787
But you don't want brand recognition.

556
00:29:57,787 --> 00:29:59,808
I mean, it's nice, but you want conversion.

557
00:30:00,293 --> 00:30:03,595
You want people to click on your ad and buy the game.

558
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:07,117
I mean, if they know it but don't buy it,

559
00:30:07,117 --> 00:30:09,038
it shouldn't matter to most of you.

560
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:09,659
So pay per click.

561
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:11,460
You can track this stuff.

562
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,141
You can track most of the conversions.

563
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:15,662
Although, if you use Steam, it's sort of hard

564
00:30:15,662 --> 00:30:16,723
to see if it works or not.

565
00:30:16,723 --> 00:30:19,104
So I still don't recommend it that much.

566
00:30:19,104 --> 00:30:20,925
But if you do it, do that.

567
00:30:20,925 --> 00:30:24,107
GIFs and videos work the best for these types

568
00:30:24,107 --> 00:30:26,788
when we're looking at engagements.

569
00:30:33,881 --> 00:30:35,441
So what have I learned?

570
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:37,782
Read the fine print.

571
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:40,743
Now, when you launch that online game,

572
00:30:40,743 --> 00:30:42,503
you launch World of Warcraft or something,

573
00:30:42,503 --> 00:30:44,664
and you see the big terms of service,

574
00:30:44,664 --> 00:30:47,545
I know everyone just skips past that.

575
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:53,566
But now you're in management, so you need to read this stuff.

576
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:59,928
So for example, we were choosing between our back end of service.

577
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:03,309
And at the time, we chose PlayFab.

578
00:31:03,616 --> 00:31:05,217
for our very first one, before GameSparks.

579
00:31:05,217 --> 00:31:07,839
And before that, as we're working on that,

580
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,722
I spent about a year of development

581
00:31:10,722 --> 00:31:12,143
adding them into the game.

582
00:31:12,143 --> 00:31:14,645
It was supposed to be $10 a month.

583
00:31:14,645 --> 00:31:16,947
And then when we launched, I got the contract.

584
00:31:16,947 --> 00:31:20,069
And so maybe about two weeks before we launched,

585
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:21,110
I got the contract.

586
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,991
I read it over.

587
00:31:21,991 --> 00:31:25,113
And suddenly, I realized I'm not paying $10 a month

588
00:31:25,113 --> 00:31:25,834
once I launch.

589
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:29,137
I'm paying $300 a month once I first launch.

590
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,238
And for a company with no budget.

591
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:40,575
If you've launched with Steam before, you don't get paid for even two months.

592
00:31:40,575 --> 00:31:45,877
You have to wait two months and then you get paid.

593
00:31:45,877 --> 00:31:49,758
I want to explain FinePrint in Chinese.

594
00:31:49,758 --> 00:31:50,339
Sure.

595
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:57,561
FinePrint is a document that you have to read carefully.

596
00:31:58,635 --> 00:32:01,216
Yeah, so we thought we were paying $10 a month.

597
00:32:01,216 --> 00:32:03,818
Now we're paying $300 a month, US dollars.

598
00:32:03,818 --> 00:32:06,820
So that's a big difference.

599
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,822
And so we couldn't afford that.

600
00:32:08,822 --> 00:32:13,845
And so we ended up having to spend 150 hours to port

601
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:15,686
to the competitor, GameSparks.

602
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:17,928
And in the end, I did look ahead.

603
00:32:17,928 --> 00:32:22,791
And they said that they would give me a free account,

604
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:24,472
since we were a very small team.

605
00:32:24,472 --> 00:32:26,493
And so you guys can do that, too.

606
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:29,548
If you go to gamesparks.com and you have a small team,

607
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:36,073
small as in full-time, you can get a free Gamesparks BaaS account.

608
00:32:36,073 --> 00:32:41,557
As long as you have under 100,000 people per month,

609
00:32:41,557 --> 00:32:44,499
which is a lot, we don't even have half that,

610
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:49,182
then you get it for free, with no limitations.

611
00:32:49,182 --> 00:32:51,104
It's awesome.

612
00:32:54,511 --> 00:32:59,293
So as for PR firms, a lot of people, they wonder if they need PR or not.

613
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:01,635
And the answer is probably no.

614
00:33:01,635 --> 00:33:03,095
Almost every time.

615
00:33:03,095 --> 00:33:09,238
The PR guys, what I just taught you earlier about Buffer and all that, they're using that.

616
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:09,939
You can do that.

617
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:14,161
It seems like they're doing a lot, but all they do is they know the tools.

618
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:21,965
And we actually hired a PR firm at the beginning for our Kickstarter, and we spent about $1

619
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:25,048
We spent too much. We spent like $2,000 US dollars,

620
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:26,929
$3,000 US dollars, which was all of our budget on PR.

621
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:29,150
And so this ended up being a mistake.

622
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:38,256
So in the end, I realized that people, bloggers and news people for gaming,

623
00:33:38,256 --> 00:33:43,999
they don't really care about Kickstarters.

624
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:50,083
You know, people have Kickstarters so often these days that it's just not news anymore.

625
00:33:50,786 --> 00:33:55,689
And so many Kickstarters don't actually come into real games.

626
00:33:55,689 --> 00:34:01,093
So people are afraid to cover you if you have a Kickstarter.

627
00:34:01,093 --> 00:34:07,757
It may be better if you're new, if you actually launched.

628
00:34:07,757 --> 00:34:12,480
But even then, you can actually Google for press release

629
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,801
companies instead.

630
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,823
And you pay maybe $45, maybe $50 US, and they

631
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:23,766
will distribute out to maybe hundreds, thousands of emails and companies.

632
00:34:23,766 --> 00:34:26,167
You can do this yourself for $50 instead of $3,000.

633
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:30,629
Because just what I told you, this is what they do.

634
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:32,790
They know the tools, they know the sources.

635
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:37,592
And if you know what to Google, you can do it for so much cheaper.

636
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:39,273
So just skip PR firms.

637
00:34:39,273 --> 00:34:44,175
If you're going to do a PR firm anyway, at least go to their website.

638
00:34:44,175 --> 00:34:47,136
They'll always have client lists.

639
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,829
then contact those developers directly.

640
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:52,610
So somebody recently contacted me,

641
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,731
because we're on their website still.

642
00:34:53,731 --> 00:34:55,532
They asked me, what do you think about these guys?

643
00:34:55,532 --> 00:34:58,714
We're about to spend a few thousand.

644
00:34:58,714 --> 00:35:01,836
And we didn't have very good things to say.

645
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:07,980
And so we may have saved them some money.

646
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,442
So you want to set your public milestones two weeks

647
00:35:12,442 --> 00:35:14,684
after you're ready.

648
00:35:14,684 --> 00:35:15,084
We made a mistake.

649
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:22,094
So when we launched our Alpha for the first time, we launched on the same day we were ready.

650
00:35:22,094 --> 00:35:25,636
We said, we think we're going to be ready by this day?

651
00:35:25,636 --> 00:35:28,197
Well, we were, literally.

652
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:32,220
So there was no buffer time in between.

653
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,942
What ended up happening was we were in a rush, we couldn't sleep,

654
00:35:35,942 --> 00:35:41,565
we had to test a million miles an hour, we were stressed.

655
00:35:41,565 --> 00:35:43,326
It was a very stressful time.

656
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:50,541
If we would have set our launch date maybe two weeks, or even a month after we're ready,

657
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:54,324
we could polish it a little bit, we could take our time to test it.

658
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:57,546
Lots of times there's always something small that,

659
00:35:57,546 --> 00:36:02,669
something small maybe takes five minutes to change, but may have a big impact.

660
00:36:02,669 --> 00:36:09,034
For example, let's say you have a tutorial and your tutorial button didn't work or something,

661
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:13,657
then just an extra little bit of time after you think you're ready.

662
00:36:14,285 --> 00:36:18,607
it really makes a difference, not just for the players,

663
00:36:18,607 --> 00:36:20,247
but for your whole team and your body.

664
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:22,208
We use Wikia for our documentation, our rules,

665
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:26,890
our external localization.

666
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:31,733
We don't have localization in the game yet.

667
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:35,814
I know I'm surprised that you guys showed up,

668
00:36:35,814 --> 00:36:40,096
because we don't have Chinese localization yet.

669
00:36:40,096 --> 00:36:41,737
So thank you guys for coming.

670
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:48,202
So it's pretty embarrassing, but we do have external localization right now.

671
00:36:48,202 --> 00:36:54,045
And so what I mean by that is, I think I have Wikia pulled up, I do.

672
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,567
So here's the English one.

673
00:36:57,567 --> 00:37:01,649
We actually have our community translate for us.

674
00:37:01,649 --> 00:37:06,491
Because in exchange, we give them free keys.

675
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,252
Some of them just do it for free.

676
00:37:13,576 --> 00:37:16,118
Some of them just do it because they're passionate about the game.

677
00:37:16,118 --> 00:37:24,164
So you can see it's just a dump of documentation.

678
00:37:24,164 --> 00:37:27,506
We have charts here. If it's in red, the page doesn't exist yet.

679
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:29,608
If it's in blue, then the page does exist.

680
00:37:29,608 --> 00:37:33,150
And so some of it is in an English template.

681
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:37,434
You can see it's still in English, even though this is the Chinese page.

682
00:37:37,434 --> 00:37:43,078
But you can see people are slowly editing section by section about the game.

683
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:48,094
So localization is a big project.

684
00:37:48,094 --> 00:37:50,815
And you don't have to have it in game right at the beginning.

685
00:37:50,815 --> 00:37:53,956
What you can do is, while you're programming,

686
00:37:53,956 --> 00:37:57,276
you can ask the community to help you localize.

687
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:59,997
So when we do localize, everything is here.

688
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:02,778
And what are they working for?

689
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:06,419
You can give them game keys I mentioned earlier.

690
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:10,040
You can give them titles if you use Discord, or even in game.

691
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,900
You can give them something special.

692
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:15,152
In Discord, it takes two seconds to add them a title,

693
00:38:15,152 --> 00:38:16,472
but they're stoked about it.

694
00:38:16,472 --> 00:38:21,053
We give them a secret channel called Wikia Masters.

695
00:38:21,053 --> 00:38:26,734
And so only the Wikia people that contribute and localize

696
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:28,795
can see this channel in Discord.

697
00:38:28,795 --> 00:38:30,415
It's huge for morale.

698
00:38:30,415 --> 00:38:34,336
They think it's super cool, and they're part of the community.

699
00:38:34,336 --> 00:38:35,176
They're engaged.

700
00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:37,757
And sometimes they compete to see

701
00:38:37,757 --> 00:38:42,438
who has the highest edit counts, which is a win-win, you know?

702
00:38:43,283 --> 00:38:44,164
It's a wonderful thing.

703
00:38:44,164 --> 00:38:47,705
And so we actually have quite a lot of translations.

704
00:38:47,705 --> 00:38:51,586
The only thing we did was the English one.

705
00:38:51,586 --> 00:38:54,127
But even then, the community will help expand it,

706
00:38:54,127 --> 00:38:56,087
because they're very passionate.

707
00:38:56,087 --> 00:38:58,268
If you get a community to follow you,

708
00:38:58,268 --> 00:39:01,609
Discord again is the key to that.

709
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:04,350
And Discourse, that forum I mentioned earlier.

710
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,251
Then these people will help you do this for free,

711
00:39:07,251 --> 00:39:11,192
because they want their community to understand

712
00:39:11,192 --> 00:39:12,532
the game in their own language.

713
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,302
We have some people who are very passionate, and they just want to translate.

714
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:22,284
And I'm happy to do that, so I can keep developing,

715
00:39:22,284 --> 00:39:28,387
and localization will come pretty easy later.

716
00:39:28,387 --> 00:39:31,688
So, if you're looking into multiplayer,

717
00:39:31,688 --> 00:39:34,849
there are two major competitors.

718
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:36,710
You can use UNet, or you can use...

719
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,551
Oh, I think that's three.

720
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:41,092
UNet, Photon, or GameSparks.

721
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,459
Simply put, don't use U-Net.

722
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:47,821
U-Net was made by Unity, so your first bet will think, oh,

723
00:39:47,821 --> 00:39:51,283
it's made by Unity, so it's probably the best.

724
00:39:51,283 --> 00:39:56,005
Let me tell you, it's sort of an abandoned module.

725
00:39:56,005 --> 00:39:57,725
We used it.

726
00:39:57,725 --> 00:40:01,047
And there's no documentation.

727
00:40:01,047 --> 00:40:02,808
There's no support.

728
00:40:02,808 --> 00:40:03,828
And it's incomplete.

729
00:40:03,828 --> 00:40:05,189
It's sort of like an alpha.

730
00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:06,710
Maybe it will be good one day.

731
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,410
Maybe.

732
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:10,131
But for now, just simply skip it.

733
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:11,012
As for PlayFab.

734
00:40:11,513 --> 00:40:14,175
PlayFab is the competitor to GameSparks.

735
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:15,637
They don't have real-time servers,

736
00:40:15,637 --> 00:40:17,558
but they have the data sort of like GameSparks.

737
00:40:17,558 --> 00:40:21,081
With PlayFab, there's tons of limitations.

738
00:40:21,081 --> 00:40:23,983
And they may have been the example

739
00:40:23,983 --> 00:40:27,045
we used earlier for the fine print.

740
00:40:27,045 --> 00:40:29,147
So I recommend don't using them.

741
00:40:29,147 --> 00:40:31,529
Again, I think GameSparks.

742
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:35,612
GameSparks and Photon are both great.

743
00:40:35,612 --> 00:40:38,454
GameSparks does both, real-time and data.

744
00:40:38,454 --> 00:40:40,836
Photon just does real-time.

745
00:40:41,965 --> 00:40:43,607
But they both have really good documentation.

746
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:47,670
And you can make a multiplayer lobby in maybe two hours.

747
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,432
Really, it's fast, super fast.

748
00:40:49,432 --> 00:40:55,777
So about our Kickstarter, our Kickstarter,

749
00:40:55,777 --> 00:40:59,500
it's definitely a full-time job.

750
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,563
And if you think it won't be, you're in denial.

751
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:04,624
It's very hard work.

752
00:41:04,624 --> 00:41:09,608
When you're on a Kickstarter, maybe years ago,

753
00:41:09,608 --> 00:41:10,249
you could have concepts.

754
00:41:10,575 --> 00:41:12,897
But now, it's not these days.

755
00:41:12,897 --> 00:41:17,721
These days, you have to have almost a full game,

756
00:41:17,721 --> 00:41:19,482
like maybe 75% complete.

757
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:22,164
You need to have full GIFs.

758
00:41:22,164 --> 00:41:25,827
You need to have maybe 20 GIFs of the gameplay.

759
00:41:25,827 --> 00:41:29,570
You need to have a gameplay trailer ready.

760
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,773
And you also need to have a monologue at the beginning.

761
00:41:32,773 --> 00:41:35,715
Like you, yourself, preferably the owner,

762
00:41:35,715 --> 00:41:37,977
is talking about the game.

763
00:41:37,977 --> 00:41:39,118
Because on Kickstarter.

764
00:41:39,819 --> 00:41:43,863
They're not buying the game, they're buying your concept.

765
00:41:43,863 --> 00:41:46,285
They're investing in you, the developer.

766
00:41:46,285 --> 00:41:48,747
So, it's very important.

767
00:41:48,747 --> 00:41:52,131
Your speech comes before your trailer in a Kickstarter.

768
00:41:52,131 --> 00:41:53,992
So you speak first.

769
00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:55,774
You talk to the people.

770
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:58,336
Say, this is why you should invest in us.

771
00:41:58,336 --> 00:42:01,459
And you need to be very passionate about it.

772
00:42:01,459 --> 00:42:02,460
You need to show emotion.

773
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:05,427
uh... you know, even just explain like why

774
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:11,312
uh... how long you've been working on it and what it means to you. Why did you make this game?

775
00:42:11,312 --> 00:42:12,072
Just really

776
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:14,114
pour your heart and soul into it.

777
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,255
And that's

778
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:17,357
what they're investing in.

779
00:42:17,357 --> 00:42:18,458
We made a mistake earlier

780
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:20,680
at the very beginning.

781
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,481
We put the gameplay trailer first

782
00:42:22,481 --> 00:42:24,964
and then our monologue.

783
00:42:24,964 --> 00:42:26,605
And we had like a two minute trailer, it was sort of long.

784
00:42:29,264 --> 00:42:34,928
And so once we swapped it, we put our speech first,

785
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:38,110
then suddenly you could actually see the curve go up,

786
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,691
like almost immediately.

787
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:42,893
Yeah, that's when we discovered people invest in you,

788
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,875
not the game, on Kickstarter.

789
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:48,757
And so for Kickstarter, if you're in Taiwan,

790
00:42:48,757 --> 00:42:52,599
it's okay, you can still have a Kickstarter,

791
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:54,401
but you would need to have a partner

792
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:56,802
that has some sort of connection to US.

793
00:42:58,103 --> 00:43:00,926
Because it needs to go to a US bank account.

794
00:43:00,926 --> 00:43:03,648
And so if you have a friend or family or something like that,

795
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:06,150
just say you can give them a percentage.

796
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,673
Say, hey, if you help us with the Kickstarter,

797
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:13,897
we'll give you 10% just by being the agent for the bank

798
00:43:13,897 --> 00:43:18,381
or something like that, too.

799
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:19,522
Let's see.

800
00:43:19,522 --> 00:43:20,823
Oh, for trailer.

801
00:43:20,823 --> 00:43:22,885
So I mentioned earlier, we had a two-minute trailer

802
00:43:22,885 --> 00:43:24,666
at the beginning.

803
00:43:25,576 --> 00:43:31,057
The trailer I showed you earlier was our newest one, and that's been the most successful one.

804
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:34,398
So that one's only 30 seconds long.

805
00:43:34,398 --> 00:43:40,740
That means a 30-second trailer is significantly better than a 2-minute trailer.

806
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:49,022
This means it's cheaper to make, it's less stressful to make, and you may even be able to do it yourself.

807
00:43:49,022 --> 00:43:51,222
I used Filmora to make that trailer.

808
00:43:51,222 --> 00:43:53,463
I didn't hire anyone professional.

809
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:58,303
I think I paid maybe $50 for a license,

810
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:00,423
and I was able to put that together.

811
00:44:00,423 --> 00:44:05,064
And the way I did it was, I just played a whole bunch of games,

812
00:44:05,064 --> 00:44:06,745
and I kept recording them in full HD.

813
00:44:06,745 --> 00:44:10,085
So over time, I have all these different clips.

814
00:44:10,085 --> 00:44:14,286
And so if I want a specific event to happen,

815
00:44:14,286 --> 00:44:17,447
I can just pull it and throw it in the trailer,

816
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:18,467
pull it and throw it in the trailer.

817
00:44:18,467 --> 00:44:22,548
I only need 30 seconds, so it's not very stressful.

818
00:44:24,043 --> 00:44:27,585
But if you really have no desire to make a game trailer,

819
00:44:27,585 --> 00:44:31,086
you can hire someone.

820
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:32,967
Write down GameSharkStudio.

821
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:36,128
You can ask me later if you forget.

822
00:44:36,128 --> 00:44:37,089
GameSharkStudio.

823
00:44:37,089 --> 00:44:40,490
They're somewhere in Europe.

824
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:44,972
And they'll make you a really good trailer for really cheap,

825
00:44:44,972 --> 00:44:48,954
like really good price.

826
00:44:48,954 --> 00:44:51,275
We were very satisfied with them.

827
00:44:52,917 --> 00:44:56,217
Oh, and one more thing about the trailer, because it is so important, your trailer.

828
00:44:56,217 --> 00:44:58,458
Show the UI.

829
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:05,259
If you don't show the UI, even if it's gameplay, they won't believe you.

830
00:45:05,259 --> 00:45:08,280
They'll think it's a cinematic trailer.

831
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,320
And so, yeah.

832
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,241
And so we're like, no, this is, I swear, this is gameplay.

833
00:45:14,241 --> 00:45:14,981
Yeah, right, man.

834
00:45:14,981 --> 00:45:19,742
So yeah, show your UI, and they'll believe you that it's gameplay.

835
00:45:20,382 --> 00:45:24,785
And when you do have your trailer, start the gameplay instantly.

836
00:45:24,785 --> 00:45:27,547
So, within the first two seconds.

837
00:45:27,547 --> 00:45:33,092
Maybe show your... sort of like hours earlier, show your title for two seconds max.

838
00:45:33,092 --> 00:45:38,736
Then go straight to the gameplay.

839
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,038
Oh, sorry, I mentioned this for the video makers.

840
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:43,840
It's Whale Shark Studio, not Game Shark Studio.

841
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,462
I think I was having a flashback to the old...

842
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:51,698
Gameshark days on Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo.

843
00:45:51,698 --> 00:45:51,918
Okay, so

844
00:45:51,918 --> 00:45:55,861
you can have your alpha on Steam.

845
00:45:55,861 --> 00:45:58,283
Sorry, what is that 50% lower goal thing?

846
00:45:58,283 --> 00:45:59,084
50% lower goal?

847
00:45:59,084 --> 00:46:04,208
Oh, I'm sorry, I skipped a section. So for the Kickstarter,

848
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:08,152
50% lower goal, half lower goal.

849
00:46:08,152 --> 00:46:12,916
That's what you want to aim for. So, in our case...

850
00:46:13,246 --> 00:46:15,707
We asked for $20,000 because we wanted $20,000.

851
00:46:15,707 --> 00:46:17,848
That was a mistake.

852
00:46:17,848 --> 00:46:23,531
We were extremely stressed, because we only

853
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:24,851
got $21,000 in the end.

854
00:46:24,851 --> 00:46:27,112
So we barely made it.

855
00:46:27,112 --> 00:46:32,635
And if you know Kickstarter, it's all or nothing.

856
00:46:32,635 --> 00:46:34,916
So it's better to ask for half.

857
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:37,777
As long as you can actually work with half,

858
00:46:37,777 --> 00:46:41,179
as long as you can still make the game with half,

859
00:46:41,179 --> 00:46:41,679
ask for half.

860
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,052
So if we did it again, we would have asked for $10,000.

861
00:46:46,052 --> 00:46:49,615
So then once you hit $10,000, you say, oh, we're over the amount.

862
00:46:49,615 --> 00:46:50,917
If we hit $20,000, we can say 200% funded.

863
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:53,679
It sounds so good, right?

864
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,982
I mean, the PR people will just eat that up.

865
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,063
It's just great.

866
00:46:59,063 --> 00:47:01,565
And then you can have stretch goals.

867
00:47:01,565 --> 00:47:03,847
So then everyone's excited.

868
00:47:03,847 --> 00:47:06,630
They're trying to get that stretch goal.

869
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,832
Stretch goal is when you, if you make the funding,

870
00:47:09,832 --> 00:47:11,073
if you're overfunded.

871
00:47:11,443 --> 00:47:15,145
You could unlock special things in game.

872
00:47:15,145 --> 00:47:18,346
And some of it, lots of the stretch goals,

873
00:47:18,346 --> 00:47:21,027
you probably plan to do anyway.

874
00:47:21,027 --> 00:47:23,507
But if you're funded, you can say you'll do it faster.

875
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,988
You'll do it like, you'll release it with this feature,

876
00:47:25,988 --> 00:47:27,269
or maybe an extra class.

877
00:47:27,269 --> 00:47:33,831
And so that really helps your funding.

878
00:47:33,831 --> 00:47:35,731
So yeah, your alpha.

879
00:47:35,731 --> 00:47:37,792
You can have your alpha on Steam,

880
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:39,893
and it doesn't have to be early access.

881
00:47:40,654 --> 00:47:46,158
Early Access right now does not have a good vision.

882
00:47:46,158 --> 00:47:49,680
When you see an Early Access game,

883
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,562
then people are skeptical.

884
00:47:51,562 --> 00:47:53,363
They're suspicious.

885
00:47:53,363 --> 00:47:55,184
They may not want to play it.

886
00:47:55,184 --> 00:48:01,028
And if they do, they'll judge it as if it's a full release game.

887
00:48:01,028 --> 00:48:05,632
So you may get negative reviews with AAA expectations

888
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:08,594
if they run into bugs.

889
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:08,974
And so.

890
00:48:09,623 --> 00:48:13,604
What we did is we had a closed alpha and beta.

891
00:48:13,604 --> 00:48:18,064
And when I say closed, I mean, you could buy keys from our website.

892
00:48:18,064 --> 00:48:20,145
We use Stripe, by the way.

893
00:48:20,145 --> 00:48:20,485
S-T-R-I-P-E

894
00:48:20,485 --> 00:48:25,666
And so, at first we used Stripe, but if I did it again,

895
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:27,506
we would use itch.io

896
00:48:27,506 --> 00:48:28,666
I-T-C-H dot I-O

897
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:30,186
They're free!

898
00:48:30,186 --> 00:48:32,867
And you can just upload a bunch of keys,

899
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:37,088
and they'll buy it, and you can choose how much commission they get.

900
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:38,368
It's really easy.

901
00:48:39,075 --> 00:48:41,536
pretty much free.

902
00:48:41,536 --> 00:48:45,438
But the benefits are huge.

903
00:48:45,438 --> 00:48:49,039
So let's say you submit your game to Steam.

904
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:51,080
Right now, you don't have to have it voted.

905
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:51,760
They changed it.

906
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,101
All you have to do is pay $100 US, and your game is on Steam.

907
00:48:55,101 --> 00:48:59,463
It doesn't mean that it's launched yet.

908
00:48:59,463 --> 00:49:04,805
As soon as you know that your game is going to be official,

909
00:49:04,805 --> 00:49:07,586
then you do this, and you make a store.

910
00:49:08,235 --> 00:49:12,416
So your store is going to have your gameplay trailer.

911
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,357
It's going to have screenshots.

912
00:49:15,357 --> 00:49:21,178
And most importantly, it's going to have a coming soon.

913
00:49:21,178 --> 00:49:26,039
You can say when the date is optional.

914
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:27,159
Coming soon, quarter four, 2018.

915
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:29,399
And most importantly, a wishlist button.

916
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:29,859
Add to wishlist.

917
00:49:29,859 --> 00:49:30,379
This is huge.

918
00:49:30,379 --> 00:49:33,740
You can have your game launch a year later if you wanted to.

919
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,800
And you have that store there.

920
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,001
Remember that I mentioned early marketing.

921
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:39,612
This is early marketing.

922
00:49:39,612 --> 00:49:41,813
And people are adding to their wish list.

923
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:45,675
So when you do launch, every single person that added your

924
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:50,117
game to the wish list will be notified saying, hey, this

925
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:53,238
game has launched.

926
00:49:53,238 --> 00:49:56,300
You should buy this game.

927
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,100
So that really helps.

928
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,622
So for example, I think I have our store page.

929
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:02,103
Let's see, store.

930
00:50:09,303 --> 00:50:13,145
Oh wow, it's localized.

931
00:50:13,145 --> 00:50:14,185
Oh, she changed it.

932
00:50:14,185 --> 00:50:18,887
So when you have the store page, even if you're not live,

933
00:50:18,887 --> 00:50:22,369
you can have it look exactly like something like this.

934
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:27,331
You can put a little graphic, say who's on the team.

935
00:50:27,331 --> 00:50:29,552
This is really good for also if you're looking into investors

936
00:50:29,552 --> 00:50:30,913
or team members.

937
00:50:30,913 --> 00:50:35,095
If you're on the Steam store, you're official, right?

938
00:50:35,095 --> 00:50:36,655
There's something about it that's

939
00:50:36,655 --> 00:50:38,076
sort of prestigious about it.

940
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:42,025
And you just describe the game, and that's pretty much it.

941
00:50:42,025 --> 00:50:42,825
Oh, and your specs.

942
00:50:42,825 --> 00:50:47,828
Yeah, and then there's the Add to Wishlist button, which I

943
00:50:47,828 --> 00:50:55,712
don't think shows on mine.

944
00:50:55,712 --> 00:50:57,612
But it's somewhere here at the top.

945
00:50:57,612 --> 00:50:59,433
And so when you have Steam, it's free marketing.

946
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:00,254
You may as well do it.

947
00:51:00,254 --> 00:51:01,855
And also, it helps you for your release.

948
00:51:01,855 --> 00:51:04,536
It makes your release really flowing.

949
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:10,438
Because in these days, people don't want to download a third-party application.

950
00:51:10,438 --> 00:51:13,919
They don't want to download just an .exe file or something.

951
00:51:13,919 --> 00:51:15,440
It looks sort of sketchy.

952
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:21,861
Maybe they'll think it's a virus, or maybe even your antivirus will pick it up as a virus.

953
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:23,881
Even if it's not, right?

954
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:26,802
So you want something that people can trust.

955
00:51:26,802 --> 00:51:27,662
People trust Steam.

956
00:51:29,945 --> 00:51:34,526
And so you can also use the API even before you're launched.

957
00:51:34,526 --> 00:51:36,747
So you can have the login with Steam.

958
00:51:36,747 --> 00:51:39,507
You can have Steam Friends.

959
00:51:39,507 --> 00:51:42,228
You can have multiplayer servers.

960
00:51:42,228 --> 00:51:43,648
We don't use their multiplayer servers,

961
00:51:43,648 --> 00:51:44,829
but you can if you want to.

962
00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:48,709
They have free multiplayer servers you can use.

963
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:52,910
And we didn't use that because we want to dedicate it.

964
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,531
So this one's peer-to-peer.

965
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:56,771
But I hear they're actually pretty decent.

966
00:51:56,771 --> 00:51:58,472
Counter-Strike, of course, uses their own.

967
00:51:59,092 --> 00:52:04,874
servers, and I think Borderlands also uses the Steam servers too.

968
00:52:04,874 --> 00:52:18,140
Okay, so Discord is a really big part of our game, and I told you.

969
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:24,483
So we have the company server, which is private, and we have the public one.

970
00:52:24,483 --> 00:52:26,784
Then what you want is you want community moderators.

971
00:52:27,268 --> 00:52:30,389
And these guys don't just moderate your community.

972
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:33,670
They're almost like lower level developers.

973
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:36,831
They're probably going to end up being more knowledgeable

974
00:52:36,831 --> 00:52:38,712
about your own game than you.

975
00:52:38,712 --> 00:52:43,253
Because lots of times, you're more often developing your game

976
00:52:43,253 --> 00:52:45,634
rather than playing it.

977
00:52:45,634 --> 00:52:51,376
And so someone once said that if you like video games,

978
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,056
don't make video games.

979
00:52:53,056 --> 00:52:54,377
Because you won't be able to play as much.

980
00:52:55,862 --> 00:52:58,083
Anyway, Discord you can do so much.

981
00:52:58,083 --> 00:53:01,644
It's sort of like Slack if you've never used it before.

982
00:53:01,644 --> 00:53:03,125
But, for video games.

983
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:04,365
But it's even more than that.

984
00:53:04,365 --> 00:53:07,446
I mean, I would use it even for not video games.

985
00:53:07,446 --> 00:53:10,187
You can program bots to do anything.

986
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,728
There's a really good API called Discord.js.

987
00:53:12,728 --> 00:53:14,788
You can use that for free.

988
00:53:14,788 --> 00:53:19,590
And, for example, we use it for in-game engagement and moderation.

989
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:21,371
So what we can do is,

990
00:53:21,371 --> 00:53:24,192
we can type in a bot command.

991
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:29,240
to suspend a player in-game, or to warn them, or to grant them gold.

992
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,363
Let's say that someone translates your game for you.

993
00:53:32,363 --> 00:53:37,688
I can type in, like, exclamation mark, grant gold, and boom.

994
00:53:37,688 --> 00:53:40,711
And then it grants this user gold in-game,

995
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:42,292
even though I'm typing it from Discord.

996
00:53:42,292 --> 00:53:48,298
So you can think, oh, and also Discord just recently added rich presents.

997
00:53:48,854 --> 00:53:51,075
This is sort of like Steam, how they know what you're doing.

998
00:53:51,075 --> 00:53:56,438
Steam will say, he's playing Throne of Lies.

999
00:53:56,438 --> 00:53:58,619
And Discord goes even deeper.

1000
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:02,941
Discord will say, he's playing Throne of Lies,

1001
00:54:02,941 --> 00:54:06,502
and he's on day two in game.

1002
00:54:06,502 --> 00:54:09,604
Or his game is just finishing, or something like that.

1003
00:54:09,604 --> 00:54:12,905
And sort of like Steam, there's even a Join button,

1004
00:54:12,905 --> 00:54:14,766
or a Spectate button you can use.

1005
00:54:14,766 --> 00:54:17,127
So there's a lot of stuff you can do.

1006
00:54:18,908 --> 00:54:22,550
people go crazy about titles and praise and stuff like recognition

1007
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:26,312
because in our discord we have twelve thousand players

1008
00:54:26,312 --> 00:54:28,573
and it's really hard to stand out when there's

1009
00:54:28,573 --> 00:54:30,314
you know we have an average of

1010
00:54:30,314 --> 00:54:32,755
two thousand players online at the same time

1011
00:54:32,755 --> 00:54:33,756
so the list is just

1012
00:54:33,756 --> 00:54:35,777
it's just a dump of players

1013
00:54:35,777 --> 00:54:37,398
and so what ends up happening is

1014
00:54:37,398 --> 00:54:39,739
people want to stand out and so when they do

1015
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:41,860
when they contribute to the wikia

1016
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,100
or they report bugs

1017
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:46,982
you can have a bugs section, a bugs channel, a feedback channel

1018
00:54:46,982 --> 00:54:47,543
if the

1019
00:54:48,449 --> 00:54:50,350
if they help new players a lot.

1020
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:53,552
You can grant them titles to make them stand out.

1021
00:54:53,552 --> 00:54:55,314
And this really boosts morale, like crazy.

1022
00:54:55,314 --> 00:55:00,317
And for any of you that play online games,

1023
00:55:00,317 --> 00:55:02,438
if you attend like a GM event or something,

1024
00:55:02,438 --> 00:55:05,920
and you get an exclusive title, it's so cool, isn't it?

1025
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,442
It's the same thing in Discord.

1026
00:55:08,442 --> 00:55:10,563
Players feel cool about it, and it

1027
00:55:10,563 --> 00:55:15,567
makes them want to engage even more in the community.

1028
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:17,248
And what you can do, too, as game developers,

1029
00:55:17,585 --> 00:55:20,026
you can have an official game server.

1030
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:24,388
So you can see our URL is actually discord.gg slash tol.

1031
00:55:24,388 --> 00:55:28,029
And so that's because we're an official game server.

1032
00:55:28,029 --> 00:55:29,270
It didn't take much to do it.

1033
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:32,772
All we did is fill out an application and say, hey,

1034
00:55:32,772 --> 00:55:34,492
we're the real developers.

1035
00:55:34,492 --> 00:55:37,754
And this is the game that we're supporting.

1036
00:55:37,754 --> 00:55:42,056
And so suddenly you get an official verification.

1037
00:55:42,056 --> 00:55:43,997
You get the URL there.

1038
00:55:43,997 --> 00:55:45,717
And then when people join it, you

1039
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,518
can actually get a

1040
00:55:48,112 --> 00:55:50,954
Let's see, discord.tv slash tol.

1041
00:55:50,954 --> 00:55:55,378
You can actually get some splash art, and it makes it look super cool.

1042
00:55:55,378 --> 00:55:56,319
It looks very official.

1043
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,400
So, uh, oh, there it is.

1044
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,523
So it looks sort of like this.

1045
00:56:01,523 --> 00:56:05,386
And you can customize the art in the background.

1046
00:56:05,386 --> 00:56:13,133
So, when you make your games, a lot of people are going to request game keys.

1047
00:56:13,133 --> 00:56:15,474
They're going to say, I'm press.

1048
00:56:15,474 --> 00:56:17,116
I'm a famous.

1049
00:56:19,582 --> 00:56:23,242
and they'll say, I have millions of views, trust me.

1050
00:56:23,242 --> 00:56:25,463
And they're going to ask for keys.

1051
00:56:25,463 --> 00:56:32,704
So, what you do is, you say, hey, come to Discord,

1052
00:56:32,704 --> 00:56:35,105
link your Twitch account, link your Twitter account,

1053
00:56:35,105 --> 00:56:40,126
or you can even, they can also support Steam, link your Steam account,

1054
00:56:40,126 --> 00:56:43,587
and we'll give you keys. You'll find very fast

1055
00:56:43,587 --> 00:56:48,648
that half the people never come to Discord because they're fake.

1056
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:56,659
So, more than half, I'd say about 75% of the people that ask for keys are fake.

1057
00:56:56,659 --> 00:57:07,047
So, Discord, because you can link your accounts, this has been an invaluable tool to verify people, to see if they're real or not.

1058
00:57:07,047 --> 00:57:15,834
And ever since then, we haven't seen any keys on, you know, Kinguin and G2A.

1059
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:16,815
Speaking of which...

1060
00:57:17,192 --> 00:57:22,815
If your game does end up on Kinguin or G2A without your permission,

1061
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:27,337
you can send them a message, like an official message,

1062
00:57:27,337 --> 00:57:30,558
say, hey, please take it down and blacklist,

1063
00:57:30,558 --> 00:57:33,800
and then make sure you speak to the manager.

1064
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:40,683
We did that, and they made sure that they won't show our game on Kinguin or G2A ever again.

1065
00:57:40,683 --> 00:57:43,444
I'm sure this helps some of you guys out there.

1066
00:57:43,444 --> 00:57:45,385
You know what I'm talking about.

1067
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:52,722
So in your Discord, you also want to have, I mentioned earlier, a feedback and bugs section.

1068
00:57:52,722 --> 00:57:54,743
Just have it, just have them dump it there.

1069
00:57:54,743 --> 00:57:56,925
You can have some bot commands for FAQs,

1070
00:57:56,925 --> 00:58:00,407
like how to get your logs to post it in the bug reports,

1071
00:58:00,407 --> 00:58:02,548
how, uh, FAQ for, like, uh, your links,

1072
00:58:02,548 --> 00:58:05,249
or, you know, anything complex that you say over and over.

1073
00:58:05,249 --> 00:58:06,770
You can have it all bot commands.

1074
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:10,492
And so, it's sort of like if you ever watched a Twitch streamer,

1075
00:58:10,492 --> 00:58:14,634
you know, you can type ! and a command, and lots of times it'll give them links or information.

1076
00:58:14,634 --> 00:58:16,775
You can do something like that.

1077
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:22,700
And then news have a read-only section for players to see.

1078
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:26,322
You can tag everyone, so that even if they're offline,

1079
00:58:26,322 --> 00:58:30,784
they'll eventually see it.

1080
00:58:30,784 --> 00:58:33,425
Let's go to the next slide here.

1081
00:58:33,425 --> 00:58:36,867
So let's talk about Unity.

1082
00:58:36,867 --> 00:58:38,468
Why Unity?

1083
00:58:38,468 --> 00:58:40,789
Well, Unity is free while developing.

1084
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:43,490
That's always an incentive for indie devs.

1085
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:45,311
They have an asset store that's invaluable.

1086
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:50,487
The asset store, I'm sure that you've all experienced it if you've used Unity before.

1087
00:58:50,487 --> 00:58:53,508
They have tons of free assets, or almost free assets.

1088
00:58:53,508 --> 00:58:58,850
Don't forget that your game doesn't have to start with the final assets.

1089
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:02,532
You saw my blooper video at the very beginning.

1090
00:59:02,532 --> 00:59:07,374
Our game models don't look like that, the textures don't look like that, neither do the shadings.

1091
00:59:07,374 --> 00:59:11,135
But it really allowed us to get started fast.

1092
00:59:11,135 --> 00:59:14,077
To just throw something in there instead of just squares.

1093
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:21,475
you could have just squares, but it's sort of good for morale, and it's good for screenshots.

1094
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:26,498
And especially if you're doing a Kickstarter, or you're trying to get some press,

1095
00:59:26,498 --> 00:59:31,462
if you show someone with some type of model, or environment, or art, or some sort of placeholders,

1096
00:59:31,462 --> 00:59:37,005
it's better than just squares, and black and white.

1097
00:59:37,677 --> 00:59:40,618
And that pretty much is the definition of prototyping.

1098
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,238
It's just having a bunch of placeholders

1099
00:59:42,238 --> 00:59:44,858
so that people can envision what your game will

1100
00:59:44,858 --> 00:59:46,419
be when you're finished.

1101
00:59:46,419 --> 00:59:50,199
It doesn't necessarily have to work all the way,

1102
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:54,320
but give them something to think about.

1103
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,120
Unity is high level.

1104
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:01,881
This means that unlike Unreal, you

1105
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:03,862
don't have to program memory management.

1106
01:00:03,862 --> 01:00:07,202
You don't have to program low level physics.

1107
01:00:09,344 --> 01:00:11,266
it'll probably be more efficient if you do.

1108
01:00:11,266 --> 01:00:13,607
I mean, it will be more efficient if you do.

1109
01:00:13,607 --> 01:00:15,729
But the fact that you can

1110
01:00:15,729 --> 01:00:16,690
just skip all this stuff

1111
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:20,072
and just go straight to making the game

1112
01:00:20,072 --> 01:00:21,854
is really good for morale.

1113
01:00:21,854 --> 01:00:22,875
It's good for prototyping.

1114
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:23,755
And...

1115
01:00:23,755 --> 01:00:28,159
you can always do the optimization stuff later.

1116
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:28,819
Right?

1117
01:00:28,819 --> 01:00:31,301
I mean, lots of times when you're making a game,

1118
01:00:31,301 --> 01:00:32,522
you don't want to...

1119
01:00:32,522 --> 01:00:36,425
you want to start with the game itself, not all the lower level stuff.

1120
01:00:36,425 --> 01:00:37,866
You can make games faster.

1121
01:00:37,866 --> 01:00:38,947
It's faster to learn, too.

1122
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:42,337
and they have good tutorials.

1123
01:00:42,337 --> 01:00:45,699
If you don't know something, just Google it again.

1124
01:00:45,699 --> 01:00:46,279
Watch YouTube video.

1125
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:49,421
Unity actually has built in, they

1126
01:00:49,421 --> 01:00:52,482
have their own native tutorial videos.

1127
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,143
And they're very high budget tutorials.

1128
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,463
They have videos.

1129
01:00:55,463 --> 01:00:56,404
They have demos.

1130
01:00:56,404 --> 01:01:00,106
They have full games that they can give you to poke around

1131
01:01:00,106 --> 01:01:02,527
with, depending on your learning style.

1132
01:01:02,527 --> 01:01:08,850
Some people like to reverse engineer things.

1133
01:01:09,402 --> 01:01:10,923
You can do multiple ports.

1134
01:01:10,923 --> 01:01:16,825
Nintendo Switch has been really big lately for Indie developers.

1135
01:01:16,825 --> 01:01:19,906
And so you can port it straight to Nintendo Switch

1136
01:01:19,906 --> 01:01:21,126
with almost effortlessly.

1137
01:01:21,126 --> 01:01:24,447
Or at the beginning, we were just going to do Windows.

1138
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:28,829
And then we realized how easy it was to do Mac and Linux, too.

1139
01:01:28,829 --> 01:01:31,650
So we're just like, OK, all it requires us is to switch to Mac,

1140
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:34,591
build, done.

1141
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:37,151
So if you can, you may as well.

1142
01:01:37,988 --> 01:01:41,671
And so, especially if your game is very console-friendly,

1143
01:01:41,671 --> 01:01:44,453
for consoles, you may require some extra stuff,

1144
01:01:44,453 --> 01:01:45,773
like for the controller support.

1145
01:01:45,773 --> 01:01:48,195
You want buttons to go to different buttons.

1146
01:01:48,195 --> 01:01:52,398
But in the long term, it's not that much

1147
01:01:52,398 --> 01:01:59,562
to be able to port it to consoles, too.

1148
01:01:59,562 --> 01:02:00,703
And now, why not Unity?

1149
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:06,007
So Unity, they don't make games unlike Unreal.

1150
01:02:06,007 --> 01:02:06,987
Unreal.

1151
01:02:07,449 --> 01:02:10,832
makes AAA games that people want to play.

1152
01:02:10,832 --> 01:02:12,573
This means that they're developers too.

1153
01:02:12,573 --> 01:02:16,836
I mean, when I say they, I mean like the big guys,

1154
01:02:16,836 --> 01:02:19,198
the CEOs and stuff.

1155
01:02:19,198 --> 01:02:21,280
And so these guys actually are developers.

1156
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,742
And so if they run into a bug while they're

1157
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:27,124
making a AAA game, like Unreal Tournament or something,

1158
01:02:27,124 --> 01:02:31,167
then they will go in and they'll fix it.

1159
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:34,790
But as for Unity, they outsource all their demos.

1160
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:36,772
And so if they run into a bug.

1161
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:41,440
then they don't really fix it for a few years.

1162
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,283
And so there are countless unfixed bugs.

1163
01:02:45,283 --> 01:02:49,887
In our examples, in our experience, we have freezes,

1164
01:02:49,887 --> 01:02:52,349
we have crashes, we have UI bugs.

1165
01:02:52,349 --> 01:02:56,252
If you've ever used the scroller in Unity,

1166
01:02:56,252 --> 01:02:59,935
it'll always shift everything over to the side,

1167
01:02:59,935 --> 01:03:02,337
and your screen will sometimes turn pink.

1168
01:03:02,337 --> 01:03:05,920
And it's just not fun.

1169
01:03:07,058 --> 01:03:10,940
But if you experience bugs, because Unity is so modular,

1170
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,201
you can just work around it.

1171
01:03:12,201 --> 01:03:15,002
Go to the Unity store and find an alternative.

1172
01:03:15,002 --> 01:03:17,924
You don't have to use the Unity built-in stuff.

1173
01:03:17,924 --> 01:03:19,585
You don't like the scroller?

1174
01:03:19,585 --> 01:03:22,747
Go in and find a scroller, or you can make your own.

1175
01:03:22,747 --> 01:03:26,949
They make it really easy to be modular in a very simple way.

1176
01:03:26,949 --> 01:03:29,311
I made my own scroller in the end,

1177
01:03:29,311 --> 01:03:32,733
and it ended up not being, it didn't take me very long

1178
01:03:32,733 --> 01:03:35,314
to make, and then I used the template from the Asset Store

1179
01:03:35,314 --> 01:03:36,095
to help me get there.

1180
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:43,639
So yeah, you will experience bugs, but you can just skip it.

1181
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:45,921
But be sure that the upgrades are not stable,

1182
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:48,463
so be sure you copy your entire project,

1183
01:03:48,463 --> 01:03:51,105
and then try upgrading if you're ever trying to upgrade.

1184
01:03:51,105 --> 01:03:53,127
That's the only way to be safe.

1185
01:03:53,127 --> 01:03:57,330
OK, so they're free.

1186
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:58,311
They're free, actually.

1187
01:03:58,311 --> 01:03:59,792
While you're developing, it's free.

1188
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:02,114
Even when you launch, it's still free.

1189
01:04:02,114 --> 01:04:03,656
But if you do the personal edition,

1190
01:04:03,656 --> 01:04:05,177
they'll sort of shame you.

1191
01:04:05,177 --> 01:04:07,118
They'll put the personal logo at the bottom.

1192
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:11,699
So it makes you really unprofessional.

1193
01:04:11,699 --> 01:04:15,820
I've seen people give negative reviews just saying, oh,

1194
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:19,422
developers are cheap because they have the personal edition

1195
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:19,842
or something.

1196
01:04:19,842 --> 01:04:24,824
So that's something really to think about, really.

1197
01:04:24,824 --> 01:04:26,745
And so if you make over $100,000 or you

1198
01:04:26,745 --> 01:04:30,306
don't want that personal edition slash screen to show,

1199
01:04:30,306 --> 01:04:32,947
then you can pay for the licenses.

1200
01:04:32,947 --> 01:04:35,528
You don't have to jump to the pro license.

1201
01:04:35,878 --> 01:04:41,283
They have a per seat license, but they have a lower level one that's like $35 per month

1202
01:04:41,283 --> 01:04:47,008
per seat or something like that, if you make under a certain amount of money.

1203
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:48,289
So it's not bad. It's really not.

1204
01:04:48,289 --> 01:04:58,117
And then lastly, Unity does abandon modules. Think of Unreal more like a game engine and

1205
01:04:58,117 --> 01:05:04,302
Unity more like a sales engine. So lots of times they really push marketing

1206
01:05:04,302 --> 01:05:04,782
very hard.

1207
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:07,756
so they want to add, they want to get the feature list really high.

1208
01:05:07,756 --> 01:05:12,238
And so that's wonderful, I love features, but not at the cost of stability.

1209
01:05:12,238 --> 01:05:16,960
And, you know, I don't want them, I want them to continuously develop it.

1210
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,782
And in this case, I mentioned U-Net earlier, I said don't use U-Net.

1211
01:05:20,782 --> 01:05:26,004
And then they also have a service called Collab, Collaborate.

1212
01:05:26,004 --> 01:05:28,165
It's very unstable too, it's like Gits.

1213
01:05:28,754 --> 01:05:29,535
Just use Git and GitLab, guys.

1214
01:05:29,535 --> 01:05:31,997
In the end, we got rid of all of our Unity services,

1215
01:05:31,997 --> 01:05:38,143
and suddenly our game editor is way faster and way less buggy.

1216
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:53,557
So really quickly, what I plan for the future.

1217
01:05:54,786 --> 01:06:01,709
We have a private API, and that API is so that it'll spread out to other services and stuff, like Discord.

1218
01:06:01,709 --> 01:06:07,332
We want a public one, so that people can make community sites without involving us.

1219
01:06:07,332 --> 01:06:11,154
They can have stats sites and stuff, whatever they can come up with.

1220
01:06:11,154 --> 01:06:14,736
We want to improve our UI and UX experience.

1221
01:06:14,736 --> 01:06:22,060
We want to have a better community engagement, so we want to make a Twitch extension, for example, so that players can click.

1222
01:06:22,676 --> 01:06:24,997
And we have different abilities.

1223
01:06:24,997 --> 01:06:27,398
We want them to be able to hover over the abilities

1224
01:06:27,398 --> 01:06:27,999
to see what they do.

1225
01:06:27,999 --> 01:06:29,980
We want them to be able to click on a journal

1226
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,161
and it opens a journal with their last known entry.

1227
01:06:32,161 --> 01:06:35,542
There's some fun stuff you can do with that.

1228
01:06:35,542 --> 01:06:39,404
And because hardly any indie games do this, if you do that,

1229
01:06:39,404 --> 01:06:40,185
you will be on Twitch.

1230
01:06:40,185 --> 01:06:45,267
Because audience engagement is a very rare thing in Twitch.

1231
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,348
And streamers have to work really hard for it.

1232
01:06:47,348 --> 01:06:49,409
So if you can give them something,

1233
01:06:49,409 --> 01:06:51,430
then they're more likely to play your game.

1234
01:06:52,057 --> 01:06:53,318
And that's why we want it really bad.

1235
01:06:53,318 --> 01:06:57,101
As for publishers, people always ask,

1236
01:06:57,101 --> 01:06:57,982
do we need a publisher?

1237
01:06:57,982 --> 01:07:02,706
I would say that if you're doing PC, Mac, and Linux,

1238
01:07:02,706 --> 01:07:04,888
I would say no, you don't need a publisher.

1239
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:06,129
Except if you're going to China.

1240
01:07:06,129 --> 01:07:07,750
Because they have all these rules.

1241
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:08,871
They have tons of rules.

1242
01:07:08,871 --> 01:07:09,852
And you want to get on Tencent.

1243
01:07:09,852 --> 01:07:14,176
And especially since we're in Taiwan,

1244
01:07:14,176 --> 01:07:15,377
then you know how that goes.

1245
01:07:15,377 --> 01:07:18,679
They need to approve everything and make sure that.

1246
01:07:19,488 --> 01:07:21,750
Yeah, you want a publisher to do that.

1247
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:26,793
And also, your art assets may even be localized, too.

1248
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:30,136
So it's not just about translating it

1249
01:07:30,136 --> 01:07:32,137
to the local language.

1250
01:07:32,137 --> 01:07:32,878
It's art.

1251
01:07:32,878 --> 01:07:33,598
It's community.

1252
01:07:33,598 --> 01:07:36,180
Even the website will look different.

1253
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,261
It's localized.

1254
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:40,644
You want everything a little bit tailored

1255
01:07:40,644 --> 01:07:43,145
towards that specific demographic.

1256
01:07:43,145 --> 01:07:47,288
But yeah, I hear that if you do a mobile game,

1257
01:07:47,288 --> 01:07:48,990
almost every person I hear says.

1258
01:07:49,323 --> 01:07:51,984
If you're doing a mobile game, you do want a publisher.

1259
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:54,505
Because there are so many mobile games out there,

1260
01:07:54,505 --> 01:07:56,365
the publishers will help you stand out.

1261
01:07:56,365 --> 01:08:00,287
We want a physical card game.

1262
01:08:00,287 --> 01:08:02,948
So if you're making games, then you may as well

1263
01:08:02,948 --> 01:08:04,328
branch out as much as you can.

1264
01:08:04,328 --> 01:08:07,089
And so we have this game concept.

1265
01:08:07,089 --> 01:08:10,931
And we realized it would make a wonderful physical card game.

1266
01:08:10,931 --> 01:08:13,071
And so we don't even have to make it.

1267
01:08:13,071 --> 01:08:15,452
We just have to find a partner that's

1268
01:08:15,452 --> 01:08:17,053
very good at making these types of games

1269
01:08:17,053 --> 01:08:19,013
and say, hey, we have the concept.

1270
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,681
And you can build this.

1271
01:08:20,681 --> 01:08:21,442
Let's work together.

1272
01:08:21,442 --> 01:08:25,164
And so that's, you branch it out as much as possible.

1273
01:08:25,164 --> 01:08:30,507
And then we eventually want to keep going with new games,

1274
01:08:30,507 --> 01:08:36,951
although we want to keep updating our current one.

1275
01:08:36,951 --> 01:08:38,532
So if you guys have any questions beyond this,

1276
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:42,734
let's say we have some questions and answers,

1277
01:08:42,734 --> 01:08:46,156
and then later on you go, ah, I forgot to ask.

1278
01:08:46,156 --> 01:08:48,798
Just go on Discord and ask me.

1279
01:08:49,252 --> 01:08:51,753
I'm i42xblade, the link there.

1280
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:54,973
If you go to that link on the right,

1281
01:08:54,973 --> 01:08:56,974
throneofli.es slash blah.

1282
01:08:56,974 --> 01:09:00,915
This has everything we talked about tonight.

1283
01:09:00,915 --> 01:09:04,575
It has this PowerPoint presentation in PDF form.

1284
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:07,796
And it has some of these links.

1285
01:09:07,796 --> 01:09:10,297
Yeah, so if you're just remembering something,

1286
01:09:10,297 --> 01:09:12,657
just remember throneofli.es slash blah.

1287
01:09:12,657 --> 01:09:13,337
It has everything.

1288
01:09:13,337 --> 01:09:18,398
So, do you guys have any questions for me?

1289
01:09:19,201 --> 01:09:22,145
Sorry, so I think we already run the flower.

1290
01:09:22,145 --> 01:09:22,826
Oh, OK.

1291
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:25,289
So I think we could take a short, very short break.

1292
01:09:25,289 --> 01:09:25,469
OK, sure.

1293
01:09:25,469 --> 01:09:27,972
And we'll come back for the Q&A session, like four or five.
