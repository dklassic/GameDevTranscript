# GameDevTranscript

This repository is a quick copy of my other project [GDC-transcript](https://dklassic.github.io/GDC-transcript) to transcribe game development related materials for my own purpose that aren't from GDC.

## How to use

The tool can be accessed at [GameDevTranscript](https://dklassic.github.io/GameDevTranscript), enter video ID to attempt loading the embedded video with transcript from this repository.

You can also simply use GET method to link to the video. For example with https://dklassic.github.io/GameDevTranscript/?v=c2YRVWZupwo or https://blog.chosenconcept.dev/GameDevTranscript/?v=c2YRVWZupwo
